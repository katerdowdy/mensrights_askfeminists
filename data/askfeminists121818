0,Should students still be shown Neil DeGrasse Tyson's videos?,"Hi, feminists. I'm a middle school science teacher. Astronomy is part of my curriculum. 

Over the past 10 years, Neil DeGrasse Tyson seems to have devoted his life to appearing in every damn astronomy video made. Like, he really is in all of them! And, for the most part, the videos are good and can be valuable to kids' education.

He was accused this past week, by several different women, of various forms of sexual misconduct. The accusations range from creepiness to rape.

I've tried my best to be supportive of the metoo movement and all that's come with it.

\-Why is it not mandatory for women to serve the military in Korea? Regardless of the fact that San-E didn't go, but in general, how is that fair?

\-Why do guys have to pay for the first date? Some girls say that it's because it is the guy that asked out the girl. But that is the social norm. How often does a girl ever ask out a guy?

\-Why are females not punished harshly for falsely accusing men of rape?

Some questions:

1. Is this a reasonable response in the era of #MeToo? Where would you draw the line between firm boundaries and active discrimination (Are meetings with the office door always open discrimination? Declining to invite female colleagues out to lunch? What about going out for drinks with ""the boys"" after work and forming personal friendships?)? Is this a permanent change or the growing pains of a cultural shift?

2. Can parallels be drawn between the #NotAllMen/#YesAllMen and men concerned about false rape accusations? Why or why not? You could consider, for example, the ""poisoned M&amp;M"" analogy (Would you eat a handful of m&amp;ms from a bowl if you knew that one would kill you with 100% certainty? )

3. Given that allegations (leading to a conviction or not) alone can be enough to ruin a career (particularly in high profile fields like Wall Street), in lieu of the Mike Pence rule, what is the best way for a man to protect himself against false rape (or general impropriety) accusations? Can you give an example of where this strategy has been effective in the real world?

39,Helping against harrassment,"On mobile, apologies for any spelling mistakes. Should any details be needed, I will update.

Tonight I had a rather difficult situation, involving me (M), my coworker (F), and a slightly drunk and belligerent patron. It has left me wondering how/what to do better. 

My coworker is a very open and flirty person, especially/even moreso than our country is used to. This usually plays out predictably (bigger tips, more orders, more friendly conversations), but sometimes guys just dont want to get the hint that she isnt interested. Even dropping in her fiance doesnt deterr them. Tonight one such patron refused to take no for an answer and kept pushing the boundries. He wasnt violent, but he was frustrated (not far from being violent). He wanted her phone number, her working hours, any little thing from her. I tried to be a distraction (the bill,  ice, his buddies talking, a brand new play being in progress the next room over), as well as politely but firmly enforcing rules (no patrons behind the counter, hands on the counter and no further), all without enraging him. But felt powerless at not knowing how to end the situation, praying that his mates will finaly drag him out for a bite. The coworker, when asked, said that I shouldnt worry, that there was nothing I could really do, and that she is used to it. Still, I would like your opinions, on how to realistically help in future such situations? Any and all tips and tricks, that wouldnt lead to my, or the coworkers, reprisals, would be most welcome. Particularly those that dont ""come to the rescue!"", as I dont want to take away her, or other coworkers, authority.

As an addition. The patron came back as we were finishing our shifts, desperately trying to get in. He was waiting for her/us as we locked the back, and we drove past him and his friends as we left the parking lot. In trying to process the situation (she apparently thought/recognized him as an alleged murderer) I made a few mistakes, one of which was unknowingly implying that she was responsible for the situation. That was never my intention, at all, (I was pointing out that her friendliness and flirting is easily misunderstood) but now I dont know whether sending her a message, specifying/apologising for that, would come across as hypocritical or creepy, or not. Your thoughts?

40,"If gender roles are primarily influenced by one's social upbringing, then why do animal's of different species adhere to gender roles?","Although I believe gender roles are natural and instinctual, I'm not making the argument that men and women should be pressured or enforced to adhere to them, especially in our contemporary society when it really isn't plausible. For instance, it is very difficult for a family to sustain a household if only one spouse has a job. Therefore, the notion that a women should, ""stay at home and watch the kids"" isn't practical in many cases. (I also want to clarify that I'm not arguing that just because these traditional gender roles are ""natural"" they are the most beneficial for society.) Furthermore, I acknowledge that not everyone fits into a box and there is always an exception to the rule. (For example, gay men have no biological motive to procreate with a women, so it really doesn't make sense for them to fulfill traditional gender roles in that sense). However, these are merely anomalies and do not dismiss the fact that there are biological motives when it comes to gender roles.

 I also do believe that there are cultural factors to gender expectations of men and women (like how certain fashion accessories and colors are prescribed to males and females).

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to animals, just think about how when a female cat gives birth, for example, it is always the female cat who fulfills the role of the ""caregiver"", it isn't a societal normal, it is based on instinct. The same applies with humans. Although, I do acknowledge that perhaps certain ways that we perceive gender are based on culture, (humans are social creatures that can be heavily influenced by their societal upbringing) but I don't think it tells the whole story. Animals are incapable of understanding the complex social structures that are put in place by humans, therefore, it would be absurd to make the assertion that, ""patriarchy"" is what is causing animals to adhere to these gender roles.  

&amp;#x200B;

To quote Simon Baron-Bohen,

""We don't want to revert to the 1960s view that human behaviour is purely culturally determined, since we now know that view was profoundly mistaken. No one disputes that culture is important in explaining sex differences, but it can't be the whole story.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Men and women don't just differ in terms of their genitalia, but in other important ways. For example, there are more than 1,000 genes on the X chromosome. Since women have two X chromosomes but men only have one, this genetic difference has an impact. Genes on the X chromosome are responsible for why 1 in 20 men but only 1 in 400 women have red-green colour blindness. Genes on the X chromosome are also responsible for why 1 in 5,000 men, but hardly any women, have haemophilia type A. Science continues apace to unravel the functions of genes. Just last year our group published [new findings of genes related to empathy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19598235) – a skill that women are, on average, better at than men.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Biological determinists don't dismiss the importance of culture. They simply don't deny the role of biology. It is a moderate position, recognising the interaction of social and biological factors. Nor, in my opinion, is biological determinism necessarily sexist. It can be sexist, if it is used to claim that all women do X and all men do Y (since sex differences don't apply to all individuals of one sex) or if it is used to perpetuate social inequalities.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The fact that gender roles are natural and instinctual does not mean that they are good or beneficial for society. Furthermore, many gender roles that are attributed to men and women that are put in place by society are not influenced by biology (like articles of clothing and colors). However, completely dismissing biological determinism is ludicrous.

41,what are the biases of /r/feminism in relation to questions for those who find themselves burdened by emotional labor duties?,"the emotional burden placed on all of us is clear as history is a nightmare.  if it so happens that human minds, being integrally connected to our bodies, are likely to contribute to our emotional labor productivity, the question here is, would you want to take up this duty regardless of its being gendered?

I think if such a ask this question here, you are asking for an obvious bias as most people would already have the answer ""no"" ready and prepared. This is because asking '[/r/feminism](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminism)' is by definition asking a population of which, many of whom, not all mind you, refuse to take on these duties and generally fail to realize the privileges/responsibilities that the vagina and 'a body that can possibly produce a child' gives; along with the associated social power that it enables.   
With great social power comes great emotional labor responsibility.

The great sad and tragic irony here is that this message will be blocked IE REPRESSED; not politically, but psychologically. Damning thousands of others to go down a great deal of feminist study for no reason other than to come out the other side.

48,"I am being blackmailed, what do i do?","I am in a pretty bad state and very worried now. I know that what I did was stupid, but I was panicking.

I had gotten threatening messages online, and one of the people I chat with online said he could help me with it. He said he could try to see if he could find any personal information about me if I have him the same information I think that the people who are threatening me have. I am extremely bad at computers, and was in the middle of panicking. He said I had to send him nudes first, and stupidly I did. I was so irrational and desperate, I had texted people asking for help but no one responded except this person.

The person found information about me, along with names of my family members, and address. I asked a friend I trust to double check if this was true and he linked me to a site where the information is.

He said that if I didn't send him more sexual pictures and videos, he'd send my photos to my dad. I begged him not to but it didn't work. I was crying at this point and terrified. He told me to send him videos or my dad would receive pictures. I did it. I had to touch myself sexually while keeping my head in a bucket of water for as long as possible. It felt awful, I feel so horrible now.

I told him I didn't want to do it but he didn't care, he also told me he had raped girls before. Eventually he said ""okay, you can stop now, I'm pleased""

I deleted my Kik account where we were talking. Was that stupid? I wanted to get away. I am a 19 year old girl btw.

51,Accused of rape at 17 for consensual sex while drunk,"My first time having sex was at a party when I was 17. We ran out of alcohol at 12, and stayed up smoking weed until 1:30 or 2. When we ran out of alcohol she suggested we get more because she wanted to get more drunk. She wasn't stumbling or slurring her words and we had very clear and lucid conversations for a couple hours. I asked her if she wanted to be my first time which she enthusiastically said ""fuck yes"". She took off all of her clothes and helped take off mine. We had sex and I was very bad, to the point where i think it hurt her and she asked me to stop. i immediately stoped and asked her how I was for my first time. ""she said you where great"" (i know she was lying). She texted me almost every day for 9 months after saying how she loves me, randomly telling me about her sexual desires, asking to hang out alone, telling me about her troubles in her life and on 4 separate occasions asking to get drunk with me (I have a record of all of this). She initiated a sexual encounter with me 4 months after us hooking up while I was much more intoxicated than her.  

Eventually she accused me of rape saying she would have had sex with me ""absolutely sober"" but also says she wasn't that drunk only a little more than tipsy. She only accused me 9 months after we had sex and right when I started dating someone else. All of the text messages between us would convince anyone not only that nothing was wrong but that she was actively flirting and pursing hanging out and getting drunk with me. Up until the day she accused me she sat next to me everyday at school and was very active in hanging out with me.

Now i kind of feel like my life is over. This happened years ago and I was never in any legal trouble because what she said I did doesn't fit the definition of rape in my state. Still I feel like I have a ticking time bomb above my head at all times, and that any success I have this will come up and I will be outcast from society. The text messages I have are very convincing that nothing was wrong, but still my situation fits in an area of consent society doesn't agree on. 

The only way this encounter would be considered rape is in the ""any amount of alcohol makes sex rape"" school of thought. I know the girl who accused me has had lots of drunk sex with other guys, and I know she has initiated some of it. It frustrates me that the only difference between my encounter with her and other her encounter with other men is how she felt months after the fact, as the text messages clearly show she had feelings for me after and continued to pursue them. 

So whats your opinion? Is all sex under any amount of mind altering substance rape? Am I a rapist? Does the difference between me being a rapist or not rest on her opinion and can that opinion change over time? Can any sexual encounter under the influence that is considered consensual at the time and for a time after be rewritten as rape and it technically count as rape because it was under the influence? Is she also a rapist because she initiated sex while drunk, or is she not a rapist because no one accused her of rape? Did she rape me because she initiated sex with me while I was drunk, which I may not have consented to while sober (i have know way of knowing if I would have been in the mood or not, because that scenario didn't happen)?

They say things like ""durr the only reason why men tend to be stronger is because of SoCiAL ConDiTIonINg"". No fucking retards, it's not ""social conditioning"", it's called fucking evolution and biology. 

Why do women in the 21st century so fiercely deny this obvious and scientific fact? It's okay to admit that there are differences, it doesn't mean that men are better than women but men are physically stronger.

68,What can you do in cases like the one of Cyntonia Brown?,"I ask this in good faith and this really complicates me.

Her case is pretty famous right now. How a sex-slave 16 years old is being sentenced to 51 years for killing a guy who tried to rape her.

My problem with this, is that i believe her, i actually believe that given her rough childhood, story of drug abuse, etc. She ended up as a sex slave and that she killed a disgusting pervert in self-defence.

The thing is that when it came to court, it was proven that she killed the guy while he was asleep making it not self-defense but still a mitigating factor, in my country at least, and that she stole things conforming an aggravating, this is important in law but to me personally, i couldnt care less if she stole things from the guy or not.

I was warned when i started studing law about my possible chudification and i try to fight it but at the same time her actions do fall in line with ''men's rea'' , even if i believe her, the codes are very clear about what should have been done.

In my country she probably would have gotten 3 years or so which i believe is fair from the perspective of law but at the same time really fucked up.

What is the feminist perspective when it comes to law? what should be done with cases like these? At first glance one would think that the judge and lawyers in that case were just monsters but their resolution is backed up by the doctrine, law is not perfect and sometimes we end up with cases like these in which i strongly believe that law is wrong but what can you do?.

She asserts that US Sec. of Education Devos’s proposed reforms to the Obama administration’s “Dear Colleague” recommendations are good since the status quo disproportionately burdens people of color. So,

1. Do you think she has a legitimate point about intersectionality and the lack of impartiality in campus rape allegations/adjudications?

2. If yes, do you agree with her proposed reforms? Briefly, that both parties should have the right to cross-examine each other via adviser (NOT directly). If you don’t like her reforms but would like reforms, what would you propose instead?

Personally, I think the article does not provide sufficient proof that the Obama “Dear Colleague” recommendations have been applied unfairly. However, it would not surprise me given the perniciousness of institutional racism in general.

Feminism says to believe all women. To believe every accusation without question... But what if there's an accusation by a white woman against a black buy and that white woman has a history of racism? Are you going to ditch your feminism and question her motives and the validity of her accusation? Or are you going to ditch your anti-racism motive and believe the accuser unconditionally? 


Second example... There's an autistic man who isn't that well socially calibrated. He isn't sexually aggressive but he is talking to a woman that's trying to give cues she's not interested in talking to him. Other women start spreading rumors about how he's a creep and a possible danger. You know he's autistic and not a threat. Do you ditch your feminism and correct the girls calling him creepy? Or do you ditch your anti-ableism and join in the girls in shaming him?

83,The REAL issues Women face,"This is a guide for every guy out there seeking to understand the problems we are all facing

Let me educate you:

1. The **Wage Gap** is real and you need to believe in it! Women earn less than Men, even when we factor in everything the patriarchy wants us to factor in. Plus, I can prove it with actual research:
   1. [Paper from National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21913.pdf)
   2. [More proof here](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/404406/ewp-538-gender-pay-gap.pdf) and [here](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/08/chart-of-the-week-equal-pay-remains-a-global-issue) and [here](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/is-gender-pay-gap-mostly-a-feminist-myth.html)
2. **1 in 5 Women** will be raped. This is not a joke. Rape is a serious thing and there is a very problematic rape culture in college campuses! We have to do something about this. And since I'm obviously not just saying it for fun, I will link all the research on this subject
   1. [Bureau of Justice statistics](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf)
   2. More research [here](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/no-1-in-5-women-have-not-been-raped-on-college-campuses) and [here](http://behavioralscientist.org/what-the-origins-of-the-1-in-5-statistic-teaches-us-about-sexual-assault-policy/)
3. **Pink Taxes!** Women ARE paying more for the same products as men and it's outrageous! Why do Women have to pay more while they earn less? And again, some real statistics from actual research:
   1. [Here](http://www.revistalatinacs.org/073paper/1261/RLCS-paper1261en.pdf)
   2. [Here](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/economics/the-pink-tax-is-a-myth)
   3. [Here](http://www.iwf.org/blog/2799310/Ladies,-Don't-Fall-for-%22Pink-Tax%22-Myth)

&amp;#x200B;

As you see, these are real problems. Not the only ones, but we definitely have to do something about these. I propose we share this knowledge to everyone we know. I don't think Men are inheritly Evil, I think most don't know the real issues Women are facing.

89,Trying to make friends without coming off as creepy,"Hello hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going through a whole self-care, trying to better myself type thing. I have a lot of anxiety and mental health issues and my therapist and I realized that I really push people away and purposely don't make friends because I assume they will suck. Basically I have a very negative outlook that most people I'll meet will be anti-feminism, or anti-lgbtq, or any of those. So I'm trying to fix that by reaching out to people that I know are very outward about their feminist views.

&amp;#x200B;

However most of these people are women. I'm way more comfortable around women as I was raised by a single mom with four sisters. But in order to reach out to these people I basically have to DM them on instagram or facebook and ask if they would want to be friends basically. I don't want it to come off as if I'm ""sliding into their DMs"" and using feminism as a way to get in their pants. I'm well aware of the kind of tactics men use. My most recent ex even told me that when we first met she assumed I was just pretending to be interested in feminism. I mean how many of you would be suspicious if you got a message from a guy asking to talk about feminism just as friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

It may seem super simple to some, to just be candid, but the last thing I want is to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Most of these people I knew in high school, where I was a very different person.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to go about it would be appreciated.

96,Do you think it's possible to be a left-wing anti-feminist/MRA?,"I consider myself to be left-wing, and on non-gendered issues I generally agree with the left. I think capitalism causes a lot of problems, I'm very concerned about global warming, I'm anti-war, etc. I even tend to agree with the left on many of the ""SJW"" issues - I'm pro-refugee, pro-gay, pro-trans, etc.

But I disagree with feminism, from a perspective that could be approximately described as MRA. I am concerned about issues such as media demonization of men and male sexuality, lack of services for male victims, erosion of due process for abuse accusations, misandrist bias in the criminal justice system, the male protector-provider role, and even (though I'm not claiming this is a ""rights"" issue) male disadvantage in mating and dating. When I express these views I'm accused of being ""right-wing"" or even ""far-right"", but I would not characterize myself that way since I disagree with right-wingers much more than I disagree with left-wingers.

Since I'm unconvinced that men are privileged over women, I don't see my defence of men as being fundamentally at odds with my other left-wing views. I'm not convinced there's anything inherently ""right-wing"" about advocating for men's issues - indeed I would argue they actually fit better with the left's broader agenda than the right's broader agenda. I would also argue in many respects feminism is much more right-wing than it admits. (I can expand with examples if you ask me to, but I don't want to make my opening post too long.)

Oh and I should mention preemptively that I don't get along with r/MensLib either, indeed I'm already banned from there. Their mission is ""helping men without blaming feminism"", and accordingly they censor anyone who criticizes feminist ideology. Whereas I think feminism is a major contributor to men's problems and therefore needs to be criticized.

So I guess my question is this. Given the above summary of my views, do I strike you as ""right-wing""? If so, what do you mean by ""right-wing""?

99,"Intersectional approaches, and rule update re: discussions about religions","We have noticed a pernicious development, where threads about the faults of religions seem to focus too much on the shortcomings of only one - Islam. To promote a better understanding of this topic, a new rule has been added:

""Discussions about Islam can only be made in the context of all the major Abrahamic religions (Christianity and Judaism).""

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/about/rules/

In this manner, all the issues that would pertain to Islam can be brought up (be they misogyny, racism, etc) but only if the discussion also includes how those social issues are treated in the other major Abrahamic traditions. The purpose of this rule is to prevent the case in which the focus of criticism is too one-sided -where only the faults of cultures historically subjected to Western hegemony appears, while similar problems in the Judeo-Christian traditions/cultures remain swept under the rug, or are swarmed on under the accusation of derailing.

[As a sideline: this is not intended to mean that other religions don't have problems of racism/misogyny - or that the atheistic community itself is safe from them.]

***

To complement the above **rule**, we also propose a *guideline* to our feminist users (who alone are allowed to make direct answers in threads).

Consider [this material](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240714229_The_Arranged_Marriage_of_Ana_Maria_Cioaba_Intra-Community_Oppression_and_Romani_Feminist_IdealsTranscending_the_%27Primitive_Culture%27_Argument) about transcending the ‘primitive culture’ argument - the author does acknowledge that a necessary part of such conversations should be:

- acknowledgement that the ""model"" (Western) culture also has its own deep issues with misogyny (and racism, etc);

- acknowledgement that the ""model"" culture/civilization has/has had a strong negative influence in perpetuating oppression in the target culture - they are in fact part of the problem;

- painting an entire culture/ethnic group in an intransigent manner forces minorities in that group (including women) to have to choose between their group/ethnic allegiances, and their own issues as women. Quoting Crenshaw, she shows that they often choose the former, resulting in a rigidification of regressive practices - the 'reactive culturalism';

- while the above are invoked/implied in many discussions, the following is too often missing:

&gt;Often, practices that are harmful to women within such groups are
either ignored in the name of preserving cultural autonomy or criticized
in a way that portrays the entire culture as primitive. To deviate from
these flawed approaches, it is necessary to apply feminist scrutiny to laws
and practices affecting women in minority communities. Whites/westerners
should not abstain from critiquing practices involving Third World
subjects, mistakenly believing that they are respecting the ‘other’s’
culture. Uma Narayan comments:

&gt;&gt;It is not clear to me that one can really learn about another culture while not
subjecting it to any critical or normative evaluation, any more than one can
really learn about another person without subjecting her to a variety of
appraisals and evaluations, both positive and negative. Most often the
commitment ‘not to judge’ other cultures seems in effect to be a commitment
‘not to express one’s judgments’ – which only serves to insulate these
unexpressed judgments from challenges, corrections, or interrogations they
might profit from.

Therefore, concern for the oppression of vulnerable groups (such as non-white minorities in Western countries) should not be a stop to valid criticism of misogyny in such groups.

This *guideline* is meant to facilitate an improvement of discussions here (so that we avoid the shortcomings of both ignoring Western faults, and of ignoring faults in other cultures - neither is justified). 

Not following the spirit or letter of this is not mod actionable (however, the general principle of not defending regressive agendas, be they homophobia, transphobia, hegemony or misogyny, always applies).

102,Do women really engage in more emotional labor when it comes to their partners?,"Emotional labor comes in many different varieties, but here I'm talking specifically about emotional labor in relation to their partner. I'm not talking about in relation to children or other duties.  


My understanding of emotional labor is that it's about regulating ones emotions both through expression and suppression, and also being considerate of the emotions of others.  


I first learned about the concept through feminism. I see it claimed that it's women who do most of the emotional labor, including in heterosexual, childless relationships, because they have to manage their own emotions as well as being considerate of their male partners.  


When I heard that last argument, it felt wrong to me. Men are taught to suppress their emotions to a greater degree than women are. There's also the stereotype of the strong, silent man who acts as a rock for the emotional, sensitive woman. This stereotype suggests that it's also up to men to suppress not only their emotions, but also help calm down their partner when they are being emotional.

 My question hinges on this: Do you think that such movements are either good or bad for feminism? On one hand, it does legitmately point to unequal ways we perceive male and female characters and their possibilities.

133,Help with final project,"I’m a Monmouth University student, doing a praxis final project on gender inequality and discrimination with an intent of teaching people about gender in today’s world. A major part of my project was making post its with an intent of making a statement that everyone matters no matter their race, gender, and sex. We live in such a gender forward country, where expressing yourself has definitely become more of a norm in this decade. However, years of oppression and discrimination cannot go unnoticed, this goes for females, male, transgender, a-gender, intersex, and gender queer folks. In western thinking science only recognizes two gender, females and males. My main focus of this project was geared towards women discrimination and inequality in all institutions (education, workforce, governmental, housing, family). Starting from the second we are born, we are thrown gender norms towards us, women getting dolls, pink toys, etc. This brings forth a very significant gender norm, one in which women are born to have children, be caring, sensitive, emotional support. This norm not only effects women through the institution of family, but it also effects education, and work force. Only 19% of America’s families are made up of American Nuclear Families, which means majority of American families are either single moms (23%), single dads (8%), and intersex families. Every 1/2 single moms are in poverty and have a 2x higher chance of asking for food stamps. This isn’t because women are incapable of working, of taking care of children, but because of oppression in all institutions. Women make 2/3 of every $1 a male makes, to this day, where African American women make 64 cents and Latina women make 46 cents for every dollar. This seems like an institutional problem right? Well it all tracks back to how we view women, when a woman walks into an interview, we are more conversational, we try to prove ourselves, where a man is more prone to being confident, walk in and make the employer know why they need them. This might seem like a personal issue, however we are used to being an emotional support, always kind, always warm, that when someone give us an offer via email we say ‘Thank you’ 4 times in that email we send back every time, maybe even add a smiley face. I find myself doing that, even after learning about it, and I have to read over my email 3 times before I send it just to seem like I’m more confident and make it seem like I belong in that said job. In the educational institution men were always the providers and women stayed home and didn’t need to get an education, in today’s generation however, we see a huge rise in women’s education. In today’s colleges 52% of women graduate with a Bachelors degree, 56% with a Masters, 42% with a Professional degree, and 37% with a PhD. And yes some degrees definitely underrepresent women, but who said we couldn’t do it! The opportunities in education we have today thanks to all those women that worked for us to be so fortunate, have not only shaped our view on gender and per say equality but they have definitely given us a chance to make ourselves known, change the world. This flows into the talk of governmental positions. In this country 19% of the US Congress is made of women, and through 30,000 mayors in out cities, 19% are women as well. So in governmental positions we see a huge underrepresentation of women, YET you see laws being passed about abortion and women rights. Abortion is a whole other topic that impacts women on a whole different level, pretty much majority men in the government have a say in what we do with our bodies, which opens up a lot of opinions on this subject. The underrepresentation of women in all institutions still allows for discrimination and inequality, it allows for these gender norms of how women should be to continue, and many organizations fight back against these laws/rights/norms everyday.

And aside: My mom is actually a single mom with 6 kids, with no help at all from my father, no money, no child support. My mom being a tailor, raising 6 children, two of which go to college, one of which goes to VoTech, working 3 jobs, definitely feels the result of institutional discrimination. A woman that works harder than anyone I have ever met to allow for a better life to her children, still struggles to get any help and/or raises at work.

To all those women out there that work just as hard, fight for an education, for their dream job, you matter. And for all those women that fight against gender norms, are intersex, a gender, gender queer, transgender, you matter as well.

151,The use of the term egalitarian,"I have been reading posts on this subreddit for a couple days, specifically in an attempt to understand the interrelations of those who use the term *egalitarian* and those who prefer the term *feminism*. 

I do understand that one is more a philosophy, while the other is advocacy. 

Labels seem very slippery to me because on one hand you have the definition and theory, and on the other, you have community and the manner in which principles are practiced or objectives executed. Often, I am more focused on the language rather than community as anecdotally, I have not been welcomed into communities, despite sharing many/most perspectives. I am an outsider amongst outsiders.

While I have done very little research into the *egalitarian* *community* other than the threads I've read here, many of which disturbed/frustrated me, my knowledge instead being more academic, I feel the definition more accurately **and succinctly** describes my own perspectives and how it relates to my personal fights for the rights of others. I believe the world is a mess of injustice, mistreatment, and oppression, and when I see this, I want to (and do) fight for any group, regardless of how I may feel personally for particular individuals. I want to help those being wronged even if they are my enemy.

Much of this is also driven by my own intersectionality in belonging to several marginalized groups and the way that has shaped my life experience. 

I was first exposed to the tension between the terms *feminist* and *egalitarian* over a decade ago, but at the time, I didn't understand why I was receiving hostility for not specifically defining myself with the term *feminist*, especially from an absolute stranger who went into a long tangent berating me. I still remember that incident because it felt like a sudden attack on me as a person, and it was also the first time I used the term *egalitarian* to describe myself. 

The question I have is: **is the stigma so great with this word that it will automatically and certainly be met with hostility when used, resulting in my exclusion from the communities that I am fighting for?** I honestly don't want to feel pressured to abandon a term that I feel suits my belief system in favor of adopting a long list of terms, some of which have communities that are in opposition of one another, despite their definitions not being in conflict, as then some would view me as a hypocrite (when not) rather than an *egalitarian*, which I am.

Just as the term *feminist* is important to those who use that word to describe themselves, *egalitarian* is an important word to me to be clear in my belief system and values. 

Also, before the conversation begins as I have seen this point expressed multiple times in the threads I have read, I do not believe that everyone naturally shares an egalitarian mindset. This is a false assumption without roots in history or reality. Most people tend to wear their prejudice very openly without shame (though I have observed in younger generations that guilt often presents prejudices covertly via liberalism). Before starting to use the word ""egalitarian"", I referred to myself as a Buddhist, but the religious connotations cause misunderstandings in western society. And while I still consider myself Buddhist and feel that it is aligned perfectly with my world views, I want to use a neutral term that is more easy to understand.

I have been an advocate and activist since I was 6 as well, formulating my own views, ethics, and beliefs. I am a very outspoken proponent for equality, justice, opportunity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of differences. This information is shared to strike down any preconceptions that an *egalitarian* does not act or that it only exists in cyberspace as theory.

169,"I don't understand how ""mansplaining"" is logically sound. In philosophy it's an obvious example of the ""ad hominim"" fallacy.","In philosophy we dismiss arguments that use the speakers' attributes to cast doubt on the argument or conjecture being made. It's effective among misogynists: ""Oh, don't trust her, she's just crazy.... and the rest.""

If a green alien said ""two plus two is five,"" the logical and sound refuction is to address the argument, not the color of the person, and not with a catchy, rhetorical statement. ""greensplaining"" is a rhetoical adhominem argument that undermines the actual flaws in argumentation.

As a feminist I don't see any benefit from adopting logical fallacies (informal and formal).

What say you? What convincing argument is there to support ad hominem rhetoric?

170,Shouldn't feminists stop spreading the idea that women are paid a lot less for the exact same work?,"First, I admit I have watched Sargon of Akkad's videos. I do not think he is 100% correct or polite, but currently I agree with him that the gender pay gap seems to be exaggerated or misrepresented. Shouldn't feminists correct the arguments?

A lot of feminists, women, even former president Obama said women are earning 77% of what men are earning for the exact same thing. Sargon said it was not for the same job. So, I typed ""gender pay gap is true"" in Google, and the top result was [this site](https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap). Judging by the narrative, I guess it is not a male supremacy conspiracy site.

According to the site, that 78% is the median salary, which disregards the the types of job or the amount of work. So, hypothetically, I mean hypothetically, if all women worked only 50% as much as all men, this statistics would mean that women actually earned more for the same work. I said hypothetically, because I only said this to mean that statistic is meaningless for the argument.

According to the site, women actually earn 97.8% as men do for the same job. I think 97.8% is quite close to the margin of error judging by the fact that it is difficult to measure how exactly two persons' work are exactly the same. I mean, even for the same team, A may think he did more than B, and B may think he did the same amount of work. Or the statement is not entire clear, because it only said the same job, not how much time they worked for. Men could have worked for longer hours.

I have clicked a few more web sites, including the BBC, and all of them were mentioning the median pay, not considering whether they did the exact same work.

So, whether the reason why women are choosing (or forced to choose) low-paying jobs or working less (or forced to work less) is due to systematic discrimination and oppression by patriarchy or due to some other factors may be debatable, but at least shouldn't feminists stop spreading this current popular notion that women are paid a lot less than men when they have done the same thing?",AskFeminists,1544698353,evolution2015,34,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/a5shfl/shouldnt_feminists_stop_spreading_the_idea_that/,2018-12-13

Well, what does it mean to identify as a gender? If someone claims they are a gender, would there ever be a case where it can be proven right or wrong? Surely no one believes that if Donald Trump said tomorrow that he identifies he's a woman, that all liberals would then accept that Trump was the first female US president. So am I wrong that the only requirement to be considered by others a transgendered person is to call yourself another gender, or is there more to it than that?

179,Why makes abortion entirely a feminist/anti-feminist issue?,"Understandably, laws surrounding sex and reproduction affect women a lot more than they do men, and therefore feminism responds to those kinds of developments in society, including abortion. I'm a woman, I'm a feminist, and I'm pro-choice in circumstances where abortion would do less harm than no-abortion. 

I'm also in favor of widespread contraception, sexual education, and social safety nets of all kinds. However, I've been told by other feminists that I should be fully pro-choice, no questions asked. To do so otherwise, they say, would be against feminism and misogyny. I don't consider the question of feminism to be the only question involved. 

In my view, abortion involves the philosophical definition of what life is. I believe that all life has value that should be respected, animals, insects, plants, even microbes everything that could be considered alive I think should be protected as much as feasible. Of course, there are circumstances where suffering/death is inevitable, we do need to eat other living beings, even if we limit ourselves to plants. 

There are circumstances where life must be sacrificed to protect other life. There are times where abortion is acceptable, but we shouldn't take it lightly. Abortion affects fetuses that would be born neurodivergent, disabled, POC, or even a certain gender. Until we can create a society free of such prejudice, we should try to protect the marginalized as much as possible. 

I don't want to create inequality or limit women's autonomy beyond what is necessary, but I've been told that feminism means supporting no-questions-asked abortion for any woman that wants it. 

In general I see pro-lifers always portrayed as always secretly wanting to control women and that there's no reason to be a pro-lifer if you're not a misogynist or at the very least, ignorant on feminism. 

Why can't someone be pro-life while not necessarily having objections to feminism?

197,Baby it's cold outside and twoxchromosomes,"So it seems like the consensus on Baby It's Cold Outside is that even though the intentions of the song are not creepy or rapey, in 2018, they may seem so.

The general idea being that intentions don't matter if people are actually harmed. And even though perhaps only a small minority of rape victims would be offended at the song, we should be nice to them and cater to their needs.

 Therefore, the feminist position seems to support the idea of banning the song from the radio. You are of course free to play the song as much as you want in private.

Is that accurate?

Okay. Some trans people have expressed the view that the subreddit name /r/twoxchromosomes for the obvious reason that trans women don't have two x chromosomes. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3pew9n/two_x_chromosomes_is_a_transphobic_name_for_a/

If you read the comments there, most people vehemently deny that this is transphobic. The arguments are

1) It was created before trans activism really took off
2) It wasn't done intentionally to upset trans women.
3) It's not a big deal so just move on with your life.
4) This only offends a small portion of the population.

Even in the worst case scenario where you'd be forced to carry the baby all the way to term you'd still have more reproductive rights than a man simply because you could put it up for adoption without having to tell the father. This says nothing for the fact that simply from a scientific standpoint you have so many birth control and emergency contraceptive options that abortion as a form of birth control should be the rarest reason a woman chooses to abort and yet it's not. And you'd think given how often women exercise their ""right"" to choose in the name of gender equality, that feminists would extend this compassion to men facing unwanted pregnancies, advocating for a man's ""right"" to opt out of supporting a child he doesn't want, but this isn't part of the feminist platform and they are suspiciously silent when these men are called deadbeats and have their names published in the newspaper. Really? No compassion? A woman taxed with a child she can't afford has a myriad of welfare options. A man who can't pay child support is thrown in jail. 

Reproductive rights are a big platform for feminists, but when you see the world through a man's eyes and you see that your only reproductive rights are condoms, celibacy or a vasectomy and that even if abortion were outlawed tomorrow women would still have far more reproductive rights than a man does, it makes it harder to be compassionate. And a man is expected to be open minded and compassionate when it comes to this aspect of women's reproductive rights because we don't know what it's like for a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy, but do women extend the same courtesy to men facing an unwanted pregnancy? If it's so horrible to imagine being forced to raise and support a child you don't want as a woman, why would it any less traumatic or emotionally and financially devastating to a man?

http://archive.li/BibnO

*loudlytransparenttrash:*

&gt;There is no rape culture. But there is a gender propaganda culture which gets spread into media, schools and politics. We are overwhelmed by false information about both men and women. It’s time to talk about just some of feminists favourite myths regarding this “Rape Culture”.

&gt;Myth #1: One in five college women are raped or sexually assaulted - This claim has been repeated so many times it’s almost beyond rational analysis. The figure is wrong.

&gt;The “1 in 5″ claim is based on a 2007 internet study with vaguely worded questions, a low response rate and a non-representative sample. If you believe we are living in a society where 1 in 5 college women are being raped then you also have to believe it is safer living in the Congo where rape is used as a weapon of war…

&gt;The real number concerning college women according to the updated and proper findings from the US Bureau of Justice Statistics is 1 in 53. That’s still far too many but it’s a long way from the 1 in 5 feminists try to scare you into believing.

&gt;Does that mean that sexual assaults aren’t a problem on campus? Of course not. Even one woman being assaulted is still too many. But it’s not an epidemic and it’s not a culture. Exaggeration and lies distracts from the real problem.

&gt;Myth #2: Women almost never lie about rape so they must be believed -Feminists often urge us dogmatically to “believe women, always believe what women say.” They do this for a reason, it’s a reaction to a long history where victims were routinely disbelieved and blamed because of their choice of clothing or their sexual history. But the answer to bad old practices is not bad new practices. The myth of the lying woman has been replaced by the myth of the woman who never lies. Why replace one with another?

&gt;Of course women lie, not because they’re women but because they’re human and human beings lie, especially about sex. Women make false accusations for different reasons. Some do it because they want to explain their way out of an embarrassing sexual encounter. Or sometimes they’re disturbed and seeking sympathy or revenge. Sometimes they’ve taken one too many feminist theory seminars and have come to believe that a drunken or regretted sexual encounter constitutes a felony rape.

&gt;Recently we have seen dozens of high-profile campus rape cases revealed to be born of false and fabricated accusations. We of course have to treat the alleged victim seriously and respectfully while at the same time being vigilant about protecting the rights of the accused. That’s called due process. Something many feminists are demanding to be abolished.

&gt;Myth #3: College women are at greater risk of rape than non-college women- The US Bureau of Justice Statistics show women enrolled in college experience LOWER rates of rape and sexual assault than their non-college peers. These absurd claims that female college students are most at risk simply have to stop. The original source of this comes from a study in 2000 by a reporter, Bonnie Fischer.

&gt;Recently Fischer was contacted to ask what data she used to justify her claims that female college students are most at risk but Fischer could not answer, she was confused and later said these claims were merely the state of belief or knowledge at the time.

&gt;The fixation on privileged college women has distracted us from the far greater vulnerability of poor or less educated women. University of Colorado Denver researcher, Callie Marie Rennison, found women without a high school diploma are sexually victimised at a rate of 53% greater than women with a high school diploma or some college. Poor women are at greater risk but they have been lost in the current panic and feminist attention of college women.

&gt;Myth #4: The predator theory of college assaults - This theory claims campus rapes are committed by 6% of males on campus and these men tend to be ruthless and incorrigible repeat offenders. This is taken very seriously by university officials and they use it to justify cutting back on due process and expelling anyone implicated in a campus sexual assault accusation. This is understandable, deans and college presidents don’t want to keep sociopaths around.

&gt;But this theory was developed in 2002 by retired University of Massachusetts Boston researcher, David Lisak. His study was based on questionnaires distributed to male passerby in a busy pedestrian area at UMass-Boston. According to Lisak, of the nearly 1900 men who returned the survey, 120 of the respondents - about 1 in 16 - admitted to committing acts that met the legal definition of attempted rape. And more than half of this group admitted to it more than once.

&gt;In critique of Lisak’s study, Slate’s Emily Yoffe, points out that the participants were hardly typical college students. Most college students are aged 18-24 whilst Lisak’s subjects were aged 18-71. Also take in account UMass-Boston is an urban commuter school with no campus housing and a four-year graduation rate of 15%. Lisak ultimately admitted to Yoffe that his study “probably needed to be replicated on a more traditional campus” but feminists are still using this as undeniable facts.
These researchers like Fischer and Lisak paint a false picture of campus life and both college and non-college women are paying the price. College women are being told to live in fear as there is no one in the country more likely to be sexually assaulted than they are. The non-college women are at far greater risk but they have been neglected.

&gt;As for men, Lisak has made it easy to demonize every 19 and 20 year old man caught up in a campus accusation and they want to see him as a ruthless serial rapist before any sort of hearing.

&gt;Will feminism ever face the facts and start using truth and real statistics to influence women?

215,The Darker Side Of Man; Modern Incel,"Modern Incel (involuntarily celibate) - The rejection of the idea that one’s unhappiness can ever be remedied.   
 

Incels are not actually seeking a female counterpart but rather enjoy  the feeling of rejection from one. Instead of romancing in the  expression of love to or from a girl/woman relationship partner they indulge in sabotage before a relationship can even be form. To indulge  in the bitter after taste of rejection.  
 

Incel is male emotional sadism upon ones self. In knowing you'll die alone and kissless virgin.  
 

Most modern incels see females as Femoids. Meaning: A portmanteau of  “female” and “humanoid” or “android,” this term is used to describe  women as non-human.  
 

A Incel will say:  
 

“By age 25 a woman has had hundreds of dicks inside her, She won't even  remember you in a few years but for you it will be a lifetime  achievement. Just fucking lol.”  
 

“Which is why right after you cum, you punch her in the face, that way she never forgets you.”  
 

An incel can only be male since a female can always get laid if she makes herself attractive enough.  
 

The joy of suffering, some modern male incels will intentionally cut there own  penises off so that they can continue to live on, never having sexual release even through self pleasure. This is to experience self torment  and inner turmoil upon ones self. It is said by those who have cut  themselves one will slowly gain powers like hyper awareness, mind  reading and a higher level of salacious madness to which they ascend by spreading that joy to others like a disease.  
 

In 2014, a 22-year-old man killed six people and wounded 14 in a mass  shooting in Santa Barbara. Before the shooting, he left behind a series  of videos and a “manifesto” in which he vowed his hatred for women and  expressed deep bitterness over his status as a virgin. In April 2018, a  25-year-old man who carried out a Toronto terrorist assault directed at  women praised the Santa Barbara shooter in a Facebook post shortly  before his own attack, which left 10 dead and 14 wounded. Which he was praised by many in the incel community.  
 

Modern incel takes idea's from the micro philosophy of Do from Heaven's  Gate and the feminist Valerie Jean Solanas SCUM manifesto to where 'a  woman bleeds a man must suffer'.

218,Where is the male privilege here?,"By US standards nearly half of all boys currently living will not survive to see there 24th birthday. Men are the majority of homeless and boys under the age of 16. Illiteracy among boys are at an all time high. Barely any medical research is done for men. Men and women died around the same age just a century ago but once feminism became pop culture women live much longer than men due to medical research funds going to women causes, none for men. Boys are more likely to be abducted and sold into sex slavery than girls. Boys are more likely to be murdered in human sacrifices than girls. Men are more likely to be murdered than women. Every 6 minutes a man is raped in person. On average men are more poor, more likely to have prolong illnesses, have a unhealthy diets, and live in poverty than women. These days all you see are boys and men in western society who are lost physically, mentally, and spiritually.  Men and boys are far more likely to commit suicide or develop mental illness never seen before. There is an upraise of males turning to satanism for guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

Where is the male privilege here? Because I don't see it. I believe once we rid ourselves of modern governments we will finally rid ourselves of feminism because Government is the major donor to feminism which keeps men down to help stabilize an elite network of a few powerful men and this is why the idea of feminism still exist today..

It  is design in a way to keep lower class systems down. For example  elitist women don't get raped by foreign men because they do not live in  the area's where these men commute. If anything Feminism supports the  wealthy of society not the other classes.

Go to any pink pussy march. The vast majority of feminist there are wealthy women and most have busy work jobs (Jobs that do not support the house hold financially) but instead live off what there husbands provide.

The fantasy aspect of Feminism in high society. Look at what Feminism pushes? Pussy hats? Fabricated wage gaps? Man spreading? These are all ideal issues for wealthy women.

Feminism  says it pushes for female equality and female independents. If a woman  is wealthy feminism works. A single mother ( due to the destruction of the male patriarchy from feminist ideals) working three jobs to support herself and family from a female force labor market, again due to feminism achievements, don't receive any benefits from feminism.

Ive so often now seen that: ""white cis women dont have any privilege over white cis men"". My beef is that I cant see why this is an important distinction. As far as I have understood, women do have some benefits to being women, an example being that women cant get drafted. The reason Ive seen feminists state as to why this isnt a privilege, is that its based around the thought process, that women are too weak to be in military positions, making it benevolent sexism rather than a privilege.

Now while I understand the difference I dont see the importance and why it needs a distinction as to not be a privilege when it still results in an advantage, even though the advantage is based in sexism. It still leads to a better life for the women in this case.

To me all the sentence ""white cis women dont have any privilege over white cis men"" does is invalidate the problems that men face and make it less likely that men want to help feminism. The alternative to the statement is that every group has some privilegde but that white cis men just have a lot more than other groups.

I have trauma from sexual abuse so have been reluctant to watch the show, though sadly it seems like something I could have enjoyed before the trauma.

240,Was democracy good for women?,"I get the impression that feminists tend to think that their goal should be a sort of radical egalitarianism...and it is an unquestioned assumption hat the more evenly distributed political power is the better it will be for women.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think anyone ever second guesses that assumption.

&amp;#x200B;

Also...feminists seem to think that women were ALWAYS worse off the further back in history one goes, and we have had to slowly 'progress' as a people to being more 'tolerant' of women (this common progressive attitude seems to have its roots in Christianity...a view of history as a progression from the primitive to the enlightened...the heathens of the past to the final rapture of the future)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway...I have my doubts.

&amp;#x200B;

Studying a great deal of medieval/enlightenment history I cannot help but notice that there were a huge number of important and respected female rulers. Elizabeth and Victoria of England (and plenty others..Mary, anne, etc)...Isabella of spain...maria Theresa of Austria....Catherine of Russia...sibylla of the kingdom of Jerusalem...joan of arc, etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact I get the impression that about say a third of great leaders in the age of monarchy were female. Its a surprisingly good representation especially if you assume that people were more sexist in the past than they are today. Ever since monarchy was abolished in the west and all the countries embraced democracy...the frequency of female leadership seems to have gone down dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

I get the impression that elites and aristocracy throughout history tend to be less concerned with the male vs. female roles than the general masses. It was not so difficult for nobility in Europe to imagine that an individual woman could have remarkable talent and judgement...while more rustic and 'salt of the earth' types might tend to be more resistant to the idea. The reduced representation of women in leadership since the start of democracy, therefore, makes some sense to me.

The impression one would get about modern feminism from main stream sources is that there is some assumption that men and women should be essentially the same. Disparate outcomes are assumed to be evidence of oppression...and the very idea of different innate talents are assumed to be some sort of blasphemy or attack on women.

&amp;#x200B;

Im not assuming that is true or false...just saying the way it seems from mainstream sources.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it is a part of elementary genetics that the behavior and abilities of life forms depends quite a lot on their genes. I think it is also scientifically understood that men and women differ by a chromosome.

I think the body and mind are connected so I think if we were to tell men not to do that then in turn we'd create unconfident people. 

Not saying it will happen because I get if you're on a bus once in awhile then it won't change shit. But i'm curious because it seems like from what I see and hear that women still want confident men but confident men also tend to establish traits of toxic masculinity.

Lastly, if manspreading isn't an issue and it's just mainly something anti feminists do to shoot down feminism then please let me know.

245,What is the feminist position on 'The Authoritarian Personality'?,"For those of you who may not know what this is, it was a book written in 1950 based on various studies of what things seem to correlate to a strong sense of ethnic group identity...which was assumed to also have some relationship to a person's potential acceptance  of fascist politics.

It just so happened that the strongest correlations seemed to involve dynamics of the family and male/female relationships.

I come from an Arabic and Muslim country and this is my second post here today.  


Many developped countries, especially Canada and Germany, are taking in a lot of our men.  


They say it's because they want to help and need more workforce but what they don't care about is that men are needed back home for protection and financial support because women aren't allowed in many jobs.  


So what is happening is that the rich countries are taking in our competent people and making the situation even worse for those that decide to stay and rebuild the country.  


In my opinion and that of my community Western countries should be less selfish and think of how many people, especially women, they're hurting by taking so many refugees.(most of whom are young men)

If a guy doesn't want to participate in traditional masculine roles during their teenage years and as they become young adults but are mocked, belittled and pressured into more traditional masculine roles by their male peers, that would be a toxic environment and thus that is where masculinity turns toxic? 

A specific example might be if a group of teenage males in high-school are socializing, and one of their peers does not want to play high school football, he does not want to wrestle in college or go to frat parties and sleep with as many women as possible, rather he would prefer to stay at home and study, hike and concentrate on his health-care or nursing major that he wants to do for a living, as opposed to college major's which are traditionally dominated by men.

Does what I have written above show that I have a decent understanding of toxic masculinity? And if so, does that mean that if we were to simply remove the mocking, belittling and pressurizing then suddenly there would no longer be a toxic environment? I.e, the act of playing football, wrestling, pursing STEM field degrees and socializing, as freshers normally do, is not in and of itself masculine behavior that could be considered toxic, but the environment by which these activities take place could be considered toxic if other alternative, less traditional roles are frowned upon by the majority of the male group?

15,Help me resolve my feelings about this incident?," 

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this. I can't seem to find the right one.

Today I was waiting in the pub for my boyfriend to meet me after his counselling session. A couple were arguing violently and she was crying. I thought I heard a few references to him hitting her, and I decided I would intervene if the situation ramped up. It’s worth noting I have very low self-esteem and I feel compelled to do the right thing (my interpretation of that, that is) at all times. If I feel I have done something morally wrong (such as omitting to intervene in this situation) I begin to experience suicidal thoughts. I have lived with suicidal thoughts for half a decade, since the breakdown of my own abusive, eight-year first relationship.

My boyfriend arrived and sat down, visibly upset, and the arguing continued to escalate, such that all we could do was sit and listen. I told my boyfriend under no circumstances was he to move from the table if I got up and left it (he has serious mental and physical health problems and also a history of getting in serious fights). The woman – her boyfriend called her Kelly – got up to go to the toilet, and her partner screamed after her, “Yeah, go buck your men, you will get battered for every one of them!” and stormed outside to smoke.

There were multiple men at the bar. One of them, presumably the owner, apologised to me across the room for the noise. I said, “Don’t apologise. I just thought if someone threatened to batter his girlfriend in a room full of men, someone might have done something.”

They had no answer.

When Kelly came back in, I approached to offer to call her a taxi. Her boyfriend was immediately back through the door and in my face. “I want to marry her. Do you want to marry her? Who are you?”

I said, “I am offering to get her a taxi because I am the only other woman in here and I am going to support her.”

He then said, “No, she’s forty, she doesn't need a taxi. I’m only thirty-five. How old are you like?” I am 28 but I probably look younger – this was irrelevant and he was just trying to intimidate me. I laughed in his face and told him I was not scared of him. I told Kelly to get away from him, because he would never change. We argued a little longer and he stormed out, pointing at me and screaming, “You weirdo, sort your brain out!”

Kelly and I had a chat, she thanked me many times and showed me photos of her blackened eyes, and promised me she was going to stay at her mum’s where he couldn’t find her. She asked me why every man she had ever been with had hit her. She told me she gave talks for a domestic violence charity after her last partner did ten years for attempting to murder her by throwing her off a bridge. And she left, alone.

None of this bothered me on a personal level (I was fuming on Kelly’s behalf and enraged with all the men there – in fact I am struggling now, as I sometimes do, with feelings of hatred towards all men- I feel this is an insidious poison in my soul, and yet I also can’t help it due to my experiences of them - I don't think I have ever met one who hasn't done me or others around them serious harm) until I came home and my boyfriend started saying I had put myself in danger in front of him, put him in a powerless position (right after his traumatic counselling session) and he thought I was going to be stabbed. He went through lecturing me on how I was going to be stabbed (I had absolute certainty that I wasn’t going to be stabbed, male-on-female stabbings are statistically absolutely negligible in our town) about 15 times over an hour. He told me repeatedly how I should PHYSICALLY POSITION myself next time I intervene in something like that. I told him he was being ridiculous, I was never in danger, and also never, ever to tell me what to do. I told him I would not do anything differently, ever, because I wasn't capable of it - I wouldn't survive the self-criticism and guilt. He cried hysterically and has gone out (perhaps with a faint implication – false – that he might be on his way to kill himself because I don’t love him – but that could just be my paranoia) and I am here in tears wondering if I really am just a terrible person. If I should not just SHUT THE FUCK UP.

Perhaps I have caused Kelly to be beaten worse than she would have been.

Perhaps I really am just a weirdo. I know that I am in fact ‘weird’ in the sense that I am not like other people – I am either very quiet or extremely loud, and I have no filter, things just come out of my mouth – and most people, frankly, don’t seem to like me. Even this drunken piece of shit seemed to know that my brain is not right.

Perhaps feminism and doing things like this is just an ego trip for me and all about my narcissism.

Perhaps I did not do or say enough.

I gathered up tablets to hurt myself but I have put them away again. My dog has licked me half to death. But I feel terrible. I just want someone to please reassure me that I am not a bad person.

I don’t wear makeup and people think the same thing about that and that is actually a choose I’ve made with feminism in mind.

My thoughts are that even though I might attribute these things to other reason I can’t deny that being aware of societal norms and my feminism has made me perfectly fine with choosing to do these things regardless of what other people think. But at the same time I’m not a perfect feminist and I don’t always think twice about things before I make a choice. What do you think? I would really appreciate some input and new ways of thinking.

32,"Rather than self-flagellation via asking random strangers questions on the internet, what are some ways a person with a past of saying/doing/thinking problematic things can have a positive impact on the world?","Part of life is growing up. Part of growing up is maturing, looking at your past actions and realizing the negative impact they may have had on others.

There is never an excuse for sexual harassment. Not even age, because it can have a long term impact on others. However, a teenager staring at breasts and making a woman feel uncomfortable for example, is far from an unforgivable sex act. A bad thing to do, harassment even, but it's not the hill to die on.

 Once you realize your mistakes, once you understand where you messed it, unless someone is specifically bringing it up to you, it does no good to dwell on it. You can't change history. There's nothing you can say or do, unless specifically asked of you. 



Rather than use it as fuel to hate yourself, for example, maybe you should use it as a means to make the world better. Use the guilt to try harder to make others feel better. Because self loathing does nobody any good.

38,"How do you feel about assisted suicide, specifically pertaining to people who are mentally ill?","Okay, I just want to say first that I am a feminist and I comment here pretty regularly and this is a genuine question.

I am for bodily autonomy completely. I've been thinking about assisted suicide lately (I'm fine). I absolutely think that someone with a disease that will only continue to harm them should be allowed to decide to end their life. If they need help, I believe it is a medical professional's obligation to help them (as allowing them to live would do them harm).

But the further I think about this, the more I consider where the line is drawn. If someone is depressed and for whatever reason unable to end their life on their own, do you think assisted suicide should be granted to them? It doesn't have to be depression. It could be debilitating schizophrenia, or any other mental illness that isn't responding to treatment.

I am, obviously, assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that most feminists here are in support of assisted suicide. If that's not the case, I'm still curious about your thoughts; however, I am primarily interested in hearing what other pro-assisted suicide feminists have to say.

43,"Patriarchy, the flipside.","I do believe that we live in a patriarchal society where men are given and expected to play the more powerful dominant role. I believe this comes from humanity requiring men to hunt and fight in tribal times and the more modern need we have for men to work the dangerous, physically demanding, and dirty jobs. I do acknowledge that our human bodies are different and that I, as a man, would have a significantly easier time functioning in a job that requires heavy physical strain. Since technology is allowing us to remove the need for physical strength to get hard labor done, I believe this will eventually end and patriarchy will no longer exist. I believe the brains of men and women are almost entirely the same especially when it comes to calculation and the skills we will need in the future.

My question is based on the idea that men are expected to be powerful and responsible. If men become aggressive after being told they need to be aggressive by society, do women not become submissive and irresponsible when they are told they aren't powerful?

53,"I don’t support most feminist policy prescriptions, not because I’m anti women, but because I dislike the method they’re implemented. Others who share my views are usually slandered as anti-women. What’s up with that?","In my day-to-day life, I’ve been exercising a real effort to treat women and men the same exact way in almost all cases. The only issues I diverge on are related to physical strength. When my lab partner is a girl and we have to do heavy lifting (not talking 10 pounds here, but like 40-50 pound things), I automatically take charge in a way I wouldn’t with men, unless I know for a fact this person could carry 50 pounds. I’d do the same for disabled people, frail men, etc. But this seems like a common sense issue most women can get behind. I’m not overly nice to women nor do i overestimate the ability of men on the basis of solely their respective genders. If I had a daughter, I’d strongly sway her to go to stem or law like I would with my son. I treat women fairly well and equally to men. By praxis, I suppose I’m a feminist- someone who believes in equal treatment of men and women. 

But I oppose nearly every feminist policy prescription there is. I’m not for government paid abortions because although I’m pro choice, they’re are a significant proportion of people who genuinely and reasonably believe abortion is murder. There is no scientifically canonic agreement for what life is. We have no scientific consensus to reference. The way I see it, pro life people are equally correct in believing fetuses are lives. They shouldn’t be taxed to pay for what they perceive to be murder. 

I oppose quotas of any kind. I’m okay with programs to increase numbers in male dominated fields, but opposed to quotas. Quotas seem one sided often. Women outnumber college students at something like 3:2, yet men don’t seem to receive the same attention from government agencies and politicians. You can’t artificially make everybody equally represented in everything without infringing on somebodies autonomy or rights. I’m okay with ways to alleviate sexism if they’re scientifically corroborated. I’m okay with diversity training. I’m okay with outreach programs. But I draw the line on quotas. I think the California decisions to make executive boards 40 percent women was reprehensible. 

I oppose a lot to welfare that is derived from life choices. I get that some people have shitty cards. That’s why I’m okay with free college and competent public k-12 schools. I’m okay with basic Medicare. I’m okay with disability. But I draw the line at some point. People in poverty shouldn’t be rewarded for behavior that propagates poverty. I don’t think single parents should be given more welfare for more having more kids. If you can’t afford kids, don’t have them. I’m even okay with subsidized birth control and contraceptions because they won’t cost that much compared to our budget and they would yield positive results. Personally, I don’t think you should have sex if you can’t afford to pay for the consequences. Sex isn’t a recreational act first. It’s an act that conceives life. You knew what could have happened. You aren’t entitled to other people’s tax money to fix your mistakes. I believe women who have extra kids but can’t afford them without government assistance should only be granted money if they agree to tie their tubes for as long as they take money. If  they don’t agree and still have more kids, cps should take their children if they can’t provide for them. I understand why cps isnt a cure  to child abuse, which is why I’m okay with significantly upping their tax funding and standard of work.

I only draw exceptions in the cases where women have been raped. I’m okay with the government subsidizing women for abortions or for welfare in these cases because the women didn’t have their own agency in these cases. True, pro lifers would argue that two wrongs don’t make a right, but in this instance, I believe the greater good is granting the women her abortion. She never asked for this.

A lot of these positions seem to anti-women. I don’t think they are at all. I have a tight code of personal responsibility and justice that I tightly hold myself to. I expect the same for others. I understand some people issues that I was fortunate to never have experienced, which is why I’m not ayn rand 2.0. I have a lot of liberal views. I’m just not a fan of a lot of feminists lobbyists because of the route they take.

62,How do I go about this?,"I've been good friends with this one person for multiple years, since around middle school. The two of us met in early childhood, as my mother used to babysit for his mother when she was at work, but, after that, the two of us didn't speak until grade eight. We're pretty close. Before he met his girlfriend, he used to make some comments that made me somewhat uncomfortable but I was in grade eight at this point, as was he, and I didn't know what to do about it, so I just got used to it, mostly ""jokes"" about us having sex one day, and he always tried to hug me, which I refused on the spot. Despite this, he continued doing it as another ""joke"". He recently broke up with his girlfriend of three years. He had a habit of bantering about sexually explicit things before this point, just jokes and shit you'd exchange with any friend, but he has recently focused his attention on me specifically again. He texted me saying he had a crush on me in middle school, and I just replied ""I know"" as a way of giving him a soft no. We moved onto other topics. He later made a comment about how I definitely wanted his dick and we'd probably hook up in the future when I was drunk. I stopped replying, and he didn't text me again. 

We now have a class together, with around ten other people, and we immediately started talking again. He went on a rant about how we got along so very well and how he ""understood"" me better than most people ever would, better than most people would try to, and put his hand on my waist. I immediately told him to stop, as I did every time he attempted to touch me in the past, and he said he was just trying to get past me. I, again, brushed it off as nothing.

He later texted me and told me that he had almost grabbed my ass. I still gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just testing the waters and seeing what he could get away with. I told him I was glad he hadn't and that it would make me very uncomfortable if he had. We continued talking, he left the chat an hour later. 

An hour later, he texts me, saying ""would you actually be mad at me if I grabbed your ass?""

I replied ""yes, I would immediately be in contact with administration.""

He immediately started giving me bullshit ""you know me, I would never do that, we're friends, that's all, you know me better than that"".

I thought I would be angrier when I saw him again, that I would tell him not to text me again for at least a week and to never touch me again, but I... Didn't. We talked today like nothing happened. And I feel like I let him off the hook for doing something completely inappropriate. 

I know exactly how this works. He got away with it. So, next time, he might actually assault someone, and it's because he faced zero consequences the first time. And he's going to get this complex that he can get away with it. And I'm the one who could've stopped if, if I just told him to never touch me again, to not contact me for a while. Whatever he does in the future, it's because I let him get away with it now. I'm contributing to this culture that lets men off the hook for doing horrible things and it's because I didn't speak up and let him believe I bought his bullshit. 

So, I guess my question is, what now?",AskFeminists,1542861827,AlCrawtheKid,3,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9zavfd/how_do_i_go_about_this/,2018-11-21

It's a sort of modern extension of the ""women and children first"" trope from bygone days.

I'm just wondering, would any feminists here agree that headlines such as these are disastrously unhelpful in the context of bridging the gaps and finding common ground between activists in particular, and people more generally, of different genders?

&gt;My name is Mike Nayna, I'm an Australian filmmaker. I started looking into a philosophical schism I saw within university humanities departments and have become tangled up in a strange and fascinating project (full papers and project fact sheet: http://bit.ly/2OsWnnH).

&gt;Right now I'm covering the story as it unfolds and trying to get a handle on the complicated subject matter. My plan is to play with footage that's unlikely to make the final cut and share it in short clips on this channel. Hopefully, I can build a network of support around the film and eventually sell the feature-length doc with a built-in audience.

71,"Is there a word for what many people wrongly refer to as ""emotional labor""?","I think it's really important to recognize that women are expected to deal with a heavier emotional load by helping the men around them feel better and being assigned to the role of caretakers. However it really bugs me when people used the phrase ""emotional labor"" as it was coined to refer to the unpaid emotional effort people (most especially women) in the service industry have to perform in order to keep their jobs. Dealing with an awful boss and awful customers and, smiling and not breaking down in the face of stress and abuse, workplace sexual harassment, etc...

I feel that using ""emotional labor"" to talk about private relationships triviliazes the intersectional nature of it. A rich woman who doesn't have to work or earns enough to live on her own may stop washing her husband's emotional laundry and leave him. It's dangerous because of sexism, but classism won't affect her. Whereas a woman who fails to provide enough emotional labor in the highly underpaid service industry will not only be unemployed and starving, but will also suffer from sexism when looking for a new job.

Anyhow, my views against Pornography (in relation to the effects on the individual) somewhat aligned with that of SWERFs and I became scared that I was harming our cause.

So, is being against Pornography because of its effects on the individual still dangerous to Feminism?

Ok so growing up was bullied quite bad by mainly women, daily name calling, assaults and breaking and entering as I lived right near the school and a specific group of women thought it would be funny to constantly break in and rob my house as well as convicting men to constantly jump me.


I suffer from social anxiety and depression and also have Aspergers so was quite socially isolated but the bullying spiraled some of my issues to the point where I was housebound due to mental health and to be blunt even my teachers who were mainly women joined in on the bullying which resulted in my mom having to higher lawyers.


Anyways sorry for the rant so I’ve been skeptical of feminism and feminist for quite awhile mymold thought process would feminism was extreme group think and I think I’ve been quite dismissive

But I’ve realized over time this isn’t fair and I’ve been attempting to hear feminists out and reflect and look into the issues feminists bring up, I also got into jordan Peterson videos and based my opinions off extreme feminists online videos for example but again I feel as if I’ve done a disservice to legitimate complaints which I’ve come to find absolutely deserve serious discussion and action and also these bias narratives I feel have really interfered with me understanding feminism and feminists.

I was wondering if you guys could recommend for me any fmeinist works to help me understand the history of the movement and how we arrived to where we are today in regards to struggles women may face?

I thought I would try to get some second opinions on the situation. I’ll try to recount what happened in the most unbiased way I can.


My mom and sister were discussing pregnancy and childbirth because we know someone who is pregnant. They were discussing the pros and cons of using painkillers during childbirth, and then started talking about different methods used for feeding the newborn baby. I said that it's healthier for the baby to be breastfed than to be fed using baby formula—a topic I had learned about in a nutrition course I took in college two years ago. My sister, visibly disconcerted, said that woman should be able to choose to do what they want with their bodies. I agreed, but responded by saying that, on average, breastfed babies tend to do better in school and have stronger immune systems compared babies who are not breastfed, and thus babies should be breastfed if at all possible. She then said that I was “mansplaining"" and that everything I said was common knowledge. She didn’t think that a man should be saying these things to a woman. I then felt like I had to defend myself against being thought a sexist.

Later, I apologized to my sister and said that it wasn’t my intention to come across as judgmental towards women who don’t breastfeed. She accepted my apology but didn’t apologize to me for implying that I was behaving in a sexist way.

Was I in the wrong here?

P.S. My sister doesn’t have any children and doesn’t plan to. My mom breastfed both of us.

93,"When are inequalities in a relationship justified, if ever?","I was thinking something along the lines of:

1. Inequalities in a relationship need to be justified.
2. Inequalities in a relationship can be justified in three ways-
a) There is no significance in the inequality such that it is not truly an inequality at all, for example, in the activity of cleaning the kitchen one partner cleans the dishes and the other dust mops and wipes down the counters.
b) The individuals in the relationship prefer the inequality. I find this one most contentious, but I wanted to gauge opinion.
c) There is some ""benefit"" to the inequality. 
3. If an inequality is not justified by the above, it should be eliminated from the relationship.

100,Questions on sexism - school project,"Hi Reddit/AskFeminists!

I am currently working on a school research project in which the goal is to make people aware of the issue of sexism. I have finished the project but am finding it to be a little dull. I was hoping to get some first hand sources that I could possibly quote in the research project. Any discussions/answers are appreciated!

Here are my questions

1. What is your general definition of sexism?
2. Is there just one type of sexism? Can you explain?
3. Can women be sexist? How?
4. What would you consider casual sexism and how does this affect people? Can you explain?

Those are some of my questions, hoping to do some good with this presentation and change some of the minds of some sexist students. ",AskFeminists,1543110563,Alex0563,5,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/a04hkm/questions_on_sexism_school_project/,2018-11-24

102,Am I misunderstanding or am I just a non-feminist?,"I may disagree with or be confused about some stuff. There's a lot of inconsistencies I've seen between various feminists and what they describe feminism to be.

The concept of the patriarchy puts me off. A lot of feminists I've talked to IRL brand feminism as a push for the equality of sexes. That isn't really the whole picture. There is a necessarily underlying belief that all of society inherently benefits men at the expense of women. I just can't see it. I'm somewhat young, and I honestly can't see any evidence that I have more opportunity than my female peers (I'm male), and that I am somehow unconsciously oppressing them. I can't see any evidence for the existence of a patriarchy that couldn't be explained by ""women and men choose different things"". If I don't believe that women are oppressed in the USA, then it seems I don't agree with a fundamental component of feminism.

Most feminists say feminism helps men too. I think that's just a misrepresentation about the whole ideology. Feminists don't seem concerned with male problems. It also seems that feminism fully embraces generalizations about men. If I were to ask ""why do men go to prison more and have longer sentences?"" the answer from feminists and non-feminists would be ""men are inherently more violent and commit more crime; so it's just the system "". Which, makes sense to me. But, if I said ""women inherently shy away from positions of power, so there is less female representation in politics"" it's misogynistic and reinforces patriarchal gender roles.

One big thing feminists like to point out is that men bottle up their emotions because and if they just cried more than it would solve a lot of their problems. Because of the patriarchal society men can't do this and suffer. Not only is that a gross generalization of all men but there isn't any evidence that any of it actually helps. All people deal with emotions in their own ways and it's a little arrogant to think feminism has some kind of proven solution for men's emotional trauma.

There's way too much criticism on ""masculinity"" and men in general. Just because a man isn't a feminist doesn't make him a sexist. The things I read from feminists about ""fragile"" and ""toxic"" masculinity seem like a big ignorant strawman. It's offensive and actually reinforce gender roles that feminists claim to want to get rid of. It's seems only masculinity can be ""toxic"", and when men act more like women, then it will solve a lot of their problems. Any downsides to femininity are ignored by feminists. This not only belittles men, but makes them very oppositional to feminism.

Lastly another big problem I find is that feminists seem to lack nuance and seem to make everything a gendered issue. If many women suffer from domestic abuse, and a man points out that men do too; they're just pointing it out to derail a female issue. A lot of problems feminists point out aren't just female problems, they're human problems. Every issue is categorized by gender and feminism seemingly only focus on women's issues. I think many feminists succumb to a sort of gender tribalism. They don't call out other feminists on prejudiced beliefs (even the crazy ones like gender critical). It's the reason men flock to MRA and and there's so many ""feminist gets OWNED with LOGIC"" crap videos on youtube. I feel like I could identify with feminism if it didn't rely on a handful of rigid beliefs that I just can't wrap my head around.",AskFeminists,1543114430,cdrizzle_,26,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/a04y4h/am_i_misunderstanding_or_am_i_just_a_nonfeminist/,2018-11-24
103,Is being transgender a mental issue?,"I have so many questions when it comes to the topic of trans women/men. If it matters: I am a young woman, never spoke to a transgender individual. Hopefully your responses will give me some insight. 

1. How does one “feel like a woman/ feel like a man” and how does that feeling not directly oppose the toxic idea that “gender is a social construct”? What is “feeling like a woman” - is it wearing makeup and frilly dresses and having long hair? 
(This is especially confusing to me as gender and sex are VERY linked psychologically. Gender is not solely a social construct, there are differences in the male/female brain apparent in childhood.) 

2. Should we accept transgenderism as normal? People do suffer from body dysmorphia, but to me this is not something to be celebrated at all. It is very depressing and abnormal to not feel like you belong in your body. If someone close to me said they felt the wrong gender and wanted to remove their sex zones I would be very concerned. I think its something that need therapy and medication like bipolar disorder or something. If someone said they hated their arms and could not live looking at their arms every day (there are mental disorders that make people hate their limbs) I would also be worried about their mental health. I would not want them to change. 

2b. How is one changing their sex acceptable but not changing their race? Both are inherited at birth features. 

3. Do you all (as feminists) believe children should have the right to pick their gender? I do not. If you do, please explain why. 

4. What about nonbinary people? This makes no sense to me at all. Why would one reject the binary instead of just.. accepting that they don’t fit into the norm of female/male? 

5. Do you think it should be legally mandated that teachers should refer to students by preferred pronoun? 
(I personally am very against this.) 

6. Final point- I feel great empathy for anyone who suffers with body dysmorphia. Statistics do not lie, transgender teens commit suicides at much higher rates than any other group.. It makes me very sad. I just don’t think the direction we are going in with society celebrating being transgender is healthy even for them themselves.

112,Sexually Liberated Women,"I read the guidelines and I hope this is an okay topic but I just need some help in this area if no one minds 

Okay so I’ve very recently started having more casual sex and one part of me is saying “as long as I am safe and it’s consensual, I can do whatever I want. It’s no one bussiness.” 

My dad will still preach about how women who use birth control look different, have rings around their eyes and are whores. Women should have value on themselves and you shouldn’t give it up easy and on and on and on. So being raised hearing that and still hearing that now, a dark part of me still feels some guilt from having sex and I was wondering if anyone has ever gone through something similar and how they got past that

119,"The word ""bitch"" in media.","I know the topic of the word ""bitch"" as an insult, and its variations comes up a lot on this subreddit. This is not what this question is about, as it is clear to me that it is a misogynistic insult.

My question is about its use in media. I cannot stand misogynistic or homophobic lyrics in music. There are many songs that use these slurs that I either appreciate musically, or appreciate other aspects of the lyrics, that I simply veto because I will not allow such things to be normalised.

However there are songs that contain no misogynistic content, other than the use of ""bitch"" as an insult. In these songs, it seems that the author is not *knowingly* being misogynistic. However, I still stand by not collecting or listening to this music because the term is misogynistic; the normalisation of its use sustains the patriarchy.

Am I right to do this?

I’m really hating myself lately. The more passionate I become to advocate for women, the worse I feel about myself. I’m notoriously hard on myself, and always have been; now that I am increasingly aware of all the harm that we men are doing, I notice I distance myself more and more from men. I have a hard time making male friends, for instance. And I even feel like I struggle with self-acceptance.

I’m not a “macho” guy by any means, but I have a lot of the typical masculine stereotypical traits, and I just hate this about myself. I’m not a very good listener. I’m a slob around the house. I have aggressive tendencies if I’m having a bad day (e.g., I have to work hard to overcome the desire to get rough with my children when they act up). I’ve also moved several times and gone through major spiritual changes lately and no longer have much of a spiritual community to belong to, which adds to my loneliness.

137,An experience from years ago. Did I do something wrong?,"For reasons which will become obvious, this is a throwaway account.

This experience happened over a decade ago but it has bothered me ever since.  I[M] was dating a girl we will call M for this discussion.  I was 20, she was 21.  I was extremely inexperienced with alcohol, I had not really tried it at that time.  

M and I had done some stuff with each other before, no sex but heavy petting and other flirty, affectionate, sexual stuff.  I was a virgin at the time and so was she (she said she was, anyway).  

During summer break she invited me to a party at the house she was living in with two other guys.  She offered alcohol.  I drank.  She drank.  They drank.  As the evening drew to a close she wanted me to come back to her room.  She knew I was inexperienced with alcohol and I told her I was not sure about our mutual states of mind, if we both were in condition to make decisions we could live with.  She assured me that I was drunker than her and that she knew her state and her limits.

We went to her room and did some heavy petting above the clothes.  I suggested we take off our clothes and continue.  We both took off our clothes and proceeded to a brief bit of oral sex in the 69 position, she was on top.  

It was brief because shortly after beginning she climbed off and started crying.  All fun times were over at that point.  I slept on the opposite side of the room from her (I had traveled over an hour to get there and was in no shape to drive home).  

In the morning she acted as though nothing was wrong and I went home.  Two days later she e-mailed me accusing me of sexual assault.  I responded with my memory of the evening - what is written above - and she apologized and dropped the matter.  

I never allowed myself to be alone with her again.

138,In what degree do you believe biology affects career choices and why?,"I've just discovered this sub and I'm really enjoying it thus far. One opinion I see being expressed here often (by feminists) is that the difference in career choices of men and women are entirely determined by social norms/culture and that biological predispositions play no role at all.

Personally I don't understand why people are so certain that this is the case. There's a couple of studies which I believe show that biology does in fact play a role. I also think that it evolutionarily it makes sense.

The crux of her argument is that women are the ones that get pregnant, that give birth and that lactate, and that it would be strange if women's psycology didn't aid them in this at all.

139,"Best ways a straight white guy can ""help"" in day-to-day situations? (Prolly cringey wording, I am new to this)","I want to keep this short and simple if I can, so bullet points on personal information are: I'm a white, Scandinavian, cisgender, close-to-thirty man of above-average privilige (I.E. from an upper middle class family, to add to all the rest).

I do already consider myself a feminist (I may very well be in the wrong on that point depending on your perspective of the term). Anyway, my partner has informed me that the two most important things I can do is speak up when my male friends (with whom she is not that familiar) use bigoted languague (they, admittedly, tend to do that quite a bit), and trying to sense when I should \*not\* be the one to speak up, as other voices are needed. I try to do this to the best of my ability, and - if I'm honest - I feel like I've been doing an OK job. But for whatever reason (may just be my social standing making me feel like I should wield more influence than I feel I do), I feel there must certainly be other things I could do as well?

If the social standing thing is the case I'd be glad to know - at least then I can rest on my tiny bed of laurels. But I am interested to know if any of you have other suggestions to especially what everyday customs I could influence other people in a good way - I am not about to become an activist (no shade thrown!), I just wanted to know if there were other ways I could use my priviliged postition to help, especially parallels to the ""speaking up to your friends"" situation.

I believe that the criminal justice system is failing because it's not focusing enough on rehabilitation, but only on punishment.

Don't get me wrong, of course i am not one of those individuals whom believe in total prison abolition(that would be lunacy imho)and i do believe that punishment is important as well, as you have to teach people that actions have conseqeunces, BUT, the goal implemented should be about reforming the criminal and reintegrating them into society(unless they're a violent criminal or something).

It's going to save taxpayers money as well, as the recidivism rates are going to decrease, so we wouldn't have to spend so much money on incarcerating folks for resemblant crimes.

Overall i believe that such an approach would potentially make our society safer.

And it's also cheaper, as it goes along with fiscal responsibility(i am a huge advocator of it personally).

Enough about my personal views though.

* Where do gender traits come from? 
* Why are some women more feminine than others and the same with men?
* Is there a ""correct"" way for one to conduct themselves based on biology?  

Perhaps this is better to ask in sociology or maybe philosophy but I thought I might ask it here as well.

191,Surprising attitudes - Why isn't this harassment?,"I'm still learning, that much is obvious.

In the thread where the OP was a male asking how to apologise for glancing at breasts, I noted that while it was sexual harassment to look at breasts because you enjoy them sexually, it's more of a microagression than anything to lose sleep over. Just try not to do that.

I got downvoted pretty low for that.

At first, I thought the issue was with me calling it a microagression. Maybe it's much more serious than that.

But nobody on this sub seems to believe glancing at breasts for the purpose of sexual fantasies is harassment.

The best reasoning I could find was ""It happens"" and that straight male brains are ""hardwired"" for noticing breasts. But shouldn't we ask for better? Shouldn't we place a burden of responsibility on men to not look at breasts without consent?

204,Your advice on leaking information about a misogynistic speaker,"Last week I attended a speaking engagement by a speaker I was wholly unfamiliar with in my home city. The speaker was from a company called 'Real Social Dynamics' whose I had watched on YouTube or a period of time when I was digging through mountains of self-improvement advice on dating, sexual attraction and relationships. To cut to the chase, the dude was a borderline psychopath and a pretty unabashed misogynist. I ended up leaving the talk after about less than an hour after it commenced. The event was pretty heavily policed by their stuff, with everyone being required to hand their phones and be frisked by staff for recording devices to the front desk prior to entering the conference room. I had thoughts of buying a USB for the cam because I had already been aware the dude had a politically incorrect 'edge' to them. Although I purposefully went to see how much of this was a mere 'marketing gimmick' and how much of this was his actual personality.

I would like to get advice on  whether I should leak information about him to the online feminist community.   If so, should I do it anonymously on a site such as this?

226,Puritanism in feminism,"Doesn't it feel like feminists views on sex seem to have a lot in common with Puritans?  Feminists seem to be moving in the direction of anti porn, anti strip clubs, anti prostitution.  We all remember that feminists were partially behind Prohibition in America.  And I can see them heading that way when they come to the conclusions that large amounts of rapes occur when people are drunk or high.

Feminists basically say that in public you shouldn't look at women or talk to them.  Unless you have something real important to say, but definitely no flirting.  Flirting with women is only allowed in places where feminists approve.  

Then you have these affirmative consent rules for having sex.  Where essentially everything is rape.

Do you think feminists views on sex are being influenced by the Puritanical values of America?  

For instance, a man can sell his body to do manual labor.  And nobody has a problem with it.  But if a woman sells her body for sex.  Feminists suddenly call it ""paying for rape"".  That means that they see sex as an extremely special case that needs extra regulations.   They don't just see sex as a natural thing that humans do, and there is no problem with selling it if you desire.

227,Questions about political correctness.,"In a movement supposedly for gender equality that is so concerned about the implications of language on gender stereotypes (i.e. ""firefighter"" instead of ""fireman"", ""police officer"" instead of ""policeman"", or even ""womyn"" instead of ""women""), how come you named the noble cause after women (feminism) and the enemy after men (patriarchy)? In my opinion, that suggests feminism stands for only the empowerment of women and the disenfranchisement of men. And hear me out... I have absolutely nothing against using gender-neutral language, but this is undeniably a huge double standard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm anticipating feminists might refute my above reasoning with the argument that men are inherently privileged, (at least in western societies), therefore, feminists cannot possibly violate the doctrine of political correctness they so highly espouse. However, the only thing you need to dispel that myth is statistics. I sourced the following from *The Red Pill* documentary (2016), which I encourage everyone to check out. All these statistics pertain to the United States:

* 90% of workplace deaths are male
* Almost all war deaths are male
* There's a widening life expectancy gap between men and women
* 75% of suicides are male
* About 40% of domestic violence victims are male... and while women have access to domestic violence shelters, men almost always get turned away.
* While feminism (rightly) repudiates practices of female genital mutilation, the routine strapping down of baby boys to doctor's tables to be circumcised without anesthesia goes unchecked.
* Less than 1 in 5 sole custody parents are male, and it's been shown time and time again that courts are biased in favor of the mother in custody battles.

And the following are sourced from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ4h-lVyaP8):

* Among people who have never been married and never had children, women earn 117% of what men do.
* Women commit more than twice as much unprovoked domestic violence against men than men do against women.
* Men get 60% longer jail sentences than women when sentenced for the same crimes with the same criminal history.

In my opinion, we don't need a gendered movement; we need a movement for gender equality. That is not feminism, as evidenced by its discrepancies regarding language (among other things), nor is that men's rights activism. Rather, it's common sense, and apparently that's not so common in 2018.

Another argument I'm anticipating from feminists is ""those are the radical/toxic feminists. Real feminists don't think that way.""

228,What do you think of Gabrielle Blairs argument concerning abortion and responsibility?,"It's an old post, but recently came up again in a discussion I was part of. Looking away from any factual inaccuracies, what do you think about her views on responsibility? Please read through the entire thing before judging.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;as a mother of six and a Mormon, I have a good understanding of arguments surrounding abortion, religious and otherwise. When I hear men discussing women’s reproductive rights, I’m often left with the thought that they have zero interest in stopping abortion.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you want to prevent abortion, you need to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Men seem unable (or unwilling) to admit that they cause 100% of them.  
&gt;  
&gt;I realize that’s a bold statement. You’re likely thinking, “Wait. It takes two to tango!” While I fully agree with you in the case of intentional pregnancies, I argue that all unwanted pregnancies are caused by the irresponsible ejaculations of men. All of them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don’t believe me?  
&gt;  
&gt;Let’s start with this: A woman’s egg is only fertile for about two days each month. Yes, there are exceptions, because nature. But one egg which is fertile two days each month is the baseline. And those fertile eggs are produced for a limited number of years. This means, on average, women are fertile for about 24 days per year.  
&gt;  
&gt;But men are fertile 365 days a year. In fact, if you’re a man who ejaculates multiple times a day, you could cause multiple pregnancies daily. In theory, a man could cause 1000+ unwanted pregnancies in just one year. While it’s true that sperm gets crappier as men age, it doesn’t have a fertility expiration date; men can cause unwanted pregnancies from puberty until death. So, starting with basic fertility stats and the calendar, it’s easy to see that men are the issue here.  
&gt;  
&gt;“But what about birth control?” you might ask. “ If a woman can manage to figure out how to get an abortion, surely she can use birth control to avoid unwanted pregnancy, right?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Great question. Modern birth control for women is possibly the most important invention of the last century, and I’m very grateful for it. It’s also brutal. The side effects for many women include migraines, mood swings, decreased libido, depression, severe cramps, heavy bleeding, aneurysm — and that’s just a small fraction of them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Discouragingly, a promising study on a new male contraceptive was canceled in large part due to… (wait for it)… [side effects](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/11/03/500549503/male-birth-control-study-killed-after-men-complain-about-side-effects). To be clear, this list of side effects was about one-third as long as the known side effects for commonly used women’s contraception. There’s a lot to unpack in that story alone. I’ll simply point out that, as a society, we really don’t mind if women suffer, physically or mentally, as long as it makes things easier for men.  
&gt;  
&gt;But, men, I’ve got good news. Even with the horrible side effects, women are (amazingly!) very willing to use birth control. Unfortunately, it’s harder to get than it should be, but that doesn’t keep women from trying. Birth control options for women require a doctor’s appointment — sometimes multiple doctor’s appointments — and a prescription. They’re not always free, and often not cheap. Some are actually trying to make female birth control options more expensive by [allowing insurance companies to refuse to cover them](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/us/politics/trump-contraception-birth-control.html). In addition, contraceptive options for women can’t be easily acquired at the last minute. In most cases, they don’t work instantly.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pill requires consistent daily use and doesn’t leave much room for mistakes, forgetfulness, or unexpected disruptions to daily schedules. Again, the side effects can be brutal — and not just in rare cases. Despite the hassle and side effects, I’m *still grateful for birth control. (Please don’t take it away.)*But it’s critical to understand that women’s birth control isn’t simple or easy.  
&gt;  
&gt;In contrast, let’s look at birth control for men — i.e., condoms. They’re readily available at all hours, inexpensive, convenient, and don’t require a prescription. They’re effective and work on demand, instantly. They don’t cause aneurysms, mood swings, or debilitating cramps. Men can keep them stocked up just in case, so they’re always prepared. They can be easily used at the last minute. I mean, condoms are magic! So much easier than birth control options for women.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a bonus, most women are totally on board with condoms. They keep us from getting STDs. They don’t lessen our pleasure during sex or prevent us from climaxing. The best part? Cleanup is so much easier — no waddling to the toilet as jizz drips down our legs.  
&gt;  
&gt;So why would there ever be unwanted pregnancies? Why don’t men just use condoms every time they have sex? Seems so simple, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh. I remember. Men don’t love condoms. In fact, it’s very, very common for men to pressure women to have sex without a condom. It’s also not unheard of for [men to remove the condom during sex](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/04/24/stealthing-removing-condom_n_16209510.html) without the women’s permission or knowledge. (Pro tip: That’s assault.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Why would men want to have sex without a condom? Because, for the precious minutes when they’re penetrating their partner, not wearing a condom gives them more pleasure. So… that would mean some men are willing to risk getting a woman pregnant — which means literally risking her life, her health, her social status, her relationships, and her career — so they can experience a few minutes of slightly increased pleasure. Is this for real?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes. Yes, it is.  
&gt;  
&gt;Imagine a pleasure scale, with pain beginning at zero and going down into the negatives. A good back-scratch falls at 5, and an orgasm without a condom is a 10. Where would sex with a condom fall? A 7 or 8? So, it’s not that sex with a condom is *not* pleasurable, it’s just not *as* pleasurable. An 8 instead of a 10.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let me emphasize that again: Men regularly choose to put women at massive risk in order to experience a few minutes of slightly increased pleasure.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the truly condom-averse, men also have a non-condom, always-ready birth control option built right in: the pull-out. It doesn’t protect against STDs, it’s an easy joke, and it’s far from perfect. However, it’s [96% effective if done correctly, and 78% effective](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/how-effective-is-withdrawal-method-pulling-out) in practice (because it’s often not done correctly).  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, many men who resist wearing condoms never learn how to pull out correctly. Apparently, it’s slightly more pleasurable to climax inside a vagina than, say, on their partner’s stomach. Once again, men are willing to risk the life, health, and well-being of women in order to experience a tiny bit more pleasure for roughly five seconds during orgasm.  
&gt;  
&gt;Think of the choice men are making here. Honestly, I’m not as mad as I should be about this, because we’ve trained men from birth to disassociate sex and pregnancy. We’ve taught them that their pleasure is of utmost importance.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a general rule, men get women pregnant by having an orgasm. Yes, there are exceptions — it’s possible for sperm to show up in pre-ejaculate — but in most cases, getting a woman pregnant is a pleasurable act for men. But men can get a woman pregnant without *her* feeling any pleasure at all. It’s even possible for a man to impregnate a woman while causing her excruciating pain, trauma, or horror.  
&gt;  
&gt;In contrast, a woman can have nonstop orgasms with or without a partner and never once get herself pregnant. A woman’s orgasm has literally nothing to do with pregnancy or fertility — her clitoris exists simply for pleasure, not for creating new humans. No matter how many orgasms she has, they won’t make her pregnant.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pregnancies happen when men have an orgasm. Unwanted pregnancies happen when men orgasm irresponsibly.  
&gt;  
&gt;A woman can be the sluttiest slut in the entire world, she can love having orgasms all day and all night long, and she will never find herself with an unwanted pregnancy unless a man shows up and ejaculates irresponsibly. Though our society tends to villainize female pleasure, women’s enjoyment of sex does not equal unwanted pregnancy and abortion. Men’s enjoyment of sex and irresponsible ejaculations do.  
&gt;  
&gt;**L**et’s move to the topic of responsibility. Often, men don’t know, don’t ask, and don’t think to ask if they’ve caused a pregnancy. There are often zero consequences for men who cause unwanted pregnancies.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the woman decides to have an abortion, the man may never even know he caused an unwanted pregnancy with his irresponsible ejaculation. If the woman decides to have the baby, or put the baby up for adoption, the man may never know he caused an unwanted pregnancy with his irresponsible ejaculation either. He may never know there’s now a child walking around with 50% of his DNA.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the woman does tell him he caused an unwanted pregnancy and that she’s having the baby, the closest thing to a consequence for him is child support. Our current child support system is a well-known joke. Only about [61 percent](http://time.com/3921605/deadbeat-dads/)of required payments by men are actually made, and there are little to no repercussions for skipping out. In some states, failing to pay child support doesn’t even affect your credit.  
&gt;  
&gt;If a man does pay child support, it doesn’t come close to what is required by a woman in the case of an unwanted pregnancy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let’s talk about abortion. When the topic comes up, men might think: Abortion is horrible; women should not have abortions. Never once do they consider the man who caused the unwanted pregnancy.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we’re discussing abortion law — and not how to hold men accountable for irresponsible ejaculations, and the unwanted pregnancies caused by them — we’re wasting our time. Shift the conversation. Stop protesting at clinics. Stop shaming women. Stop debating whether or not to overturn abortion laws. If you actually care about reducing or eliminating the number of abortions in our country, *simply hold men accountable for their actions*.  
&gt;  
&gt;What would that look like? A real and immediate consequence for men who cause an unwanted pregnancy. What kind of consequence would make sense? Should it be as harsh, painful, nauseating, scarring, expensive, risky, and life-altering…  
&gt;  
&gt;… as forcing a woman to go through a nine-month unwanted pregnancy?  
&gt;  
&gt;If you consider abortion to be murder, consider this thought experiment: Would you be on board with having a handful of men castrated to prevent 600,000 murders each year? If this argument sounds too provocative, could it be that many of us have a hard time wrapping our heads around a physical punishment for men? We seem to be more than fine with physical punishments for women. Perhaps we care more about policing women’s bodies, morality, and sexuality than we do about reducing or eliminating abortions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here’s another prevention idea: All males in the U.S. could get a vasectomy when they are ready to be sexually active. Vasectomies are very safe, highly reversible, and about as invasive as a woman getting an IUD implanted. In most cases, there’s some soreness afterwards for about 24 hours, but that’s pretty much it for side effects. (Take a moment to remember that female contraception options, used by millions of women in our country and billions across the world, have well-known side effects which can be brutal and severe — and yes, also include soreness.) If and when a man becomes a responsible adult, finds a mate, and wants to have a baby, the vasectomy can be reversed and then redone once the childbearing stage is over. Each man can bank their sperm before the vasectomy, just in case.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don’t like my ideas? That’s fine. I’m sure there are better ideas, and I challenge you to suggest your own. My point is we need to stop focusing on women if we’re trying to get rid of abortions. Think of abortion as the “cure” for an unwanted pregnancy. To stop abortions, we need to prevent the “disease” — meaning, the unwanted pregnancy itself. And the only way to do that is by focusing on men, because *irresponsible ejaculations by men cause 100% of unwanted pregnancy*.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’re a man, what would it take for you to never again ejaculate irresponsibly? A loss of money, rights, or freedoms? Physical pain? Ask yourselves: What would it take for you to value the life of your sexual partner more than your own temporary pleasure or convenience?  
&gt;  
&gt;Men mostly run our government, and men mostly make our laws. In theory, men could eliminate — or drastically reduce — abortions within months without ever touching an abortion law or even mentioning women. They’d simply need to hold men accountable for irresponsible ejaculations, and legislate accordingly.  
&gt;  
&gt;To reduce or eliminate abortions, stop attempting to control women’s bodies and sexuality. Because unwanted pregnancies are caused by men.

232,Why does feminism deal in absolutes when it comes to consent culture?,"Like there's no gray area for judgment, imo. Just black in white from what I've seen. 

Here are some examples..  If you're a male in your late 20s dating a female in her early 20s, you're a sexual predator preying on young girls... 

If you are at a party and have sex with a woman who has been drinking, you're a rapist and should be prosecuted.

Imo, in those examples, there are gray areas where the male is not a predator or a rapist. In the first example, he could just be a late bloomer and seems to relate more with partners younger than him. As long as she's within the age of consent, I don't see the issue. Now if he was 40 and she was 18, that'd be one thing. But I've seen people get criticised for just having a 5-10 year age gap.


In the second example there's also a scenerio where he isn't a predator. Imo, one or two drinks can be sober enough to consent. In my sex Ed class in high school, I was told that as long as the other person can give clear, conscious, consent than it's fair game. If they are slurring their words and not seeming alert enough, they aren't sober enough to consent.

I just feel like the term ""rape"" is starting to get broader and broader to the point that eventually all sex will be considered rape unless there's a legal binding contract.

Maybe I'm paranoid, but I haven't had sex in years because I'm scared of prison. ",AskFeminists,1543704007,JoshTheWebDev,3,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/a27n7i/why_does_feminism_deal_in_absolutes_when_it_comes/,2018-12-01
233,"What is your opinion, as a Feminist, on child support?","I am a 25 yo woman and have been fighting for child support reform for a few years now and have found that for the most part Feminism is the one that has been giving me push back on the issue.

When I was 16 I was kicked out of home by my abusive mother, when my father (who was homeless and still had child support skinning him for everything he had) came up and got me so at least I didn’t have to be homeless alone, when he was diagnosed with cancer I found out about child support first hand when they came after him, to help us get by I spent about a year, paying child support payments to my mother that was meant to be taking care of me, we called child support several times but they took my mothers word and dropped our case, eventually I got old enough that the payments stopped and it left a sour taste in my mouth.

Ever since I have been helping the fight for a reform on child support and as a result have found myself in MRA circles, for me at least they have always been a kind and supportive bunch, many of which have suffered through similar circumstances to myself. 

Despite all my experiences, my experiences with feminism have rarely been pleasant ones, I have nothing against feminism, when I was younger I Volunteered for ZONTA, helping make the birthing kits that they sent to Africa so the women could avoid some more of the preventable complications, but these days all I get from Feminism is push back on the issues I am most passionate about and being told that the kind men (and some woman) who have welcomed me and showed me nothing but support are misogynistic and are either using me or hating me behind my back.

239,On the subject of Bio Queens - What is your opinion?,"My mother and I recently got into a discussion about bio queens in the drag community and whether or not drag focusing on female gender expression should be something acceptable for cisgender women to do, and I discovered we were on completely opposite sides of the spectrum on the issue, and I still disagree with her. We only discussed drag queens, not drag kings, and I don't know what her opinion on drag kings are. We only discussed drag in reference to female gender expression. 

She argued that, since female expressive drag is an avenue of expression that is so deeply rooted in LGBT+ culture, as an avenue of challenging male gender expression, it should only be a form of artistic expression available to men and trans women, and shouldn't be an avenue of expression open to cisgender women, due to its history in LGBT+ circles as a form of liberation and revolution for trans women and gay men, because of its challenging of heteronormative standards of gender expression, as a way to challenge what standards of dress and styling should be allowed for people assigned male at birth. It's a form of liberation for people assigned male at birth and it has always been so.

I, personally, think drag exists not only as a way of pushing boundaries of socially acceptable male expression, but can parody the concept of gender as a whole, and satirize the way women are viewed in society, and that bio queens are absolutely doing this by pushing how far female gender expression can go, and taking it to extremely high levels. It works as a method of parodying female gender expression, first and foremost, and why it is considered female in the first place, and including cisgender women a conversation about what womanhood even is is incredibly important. Challenging how women are viewed and what women are through the artistic expression of fashion and makeup, using female-coded forms of expression, as a way to challenge our concept of womanhood is extremely valuable and I don't understand why it should be exclusive to people assigned male at birth.

240,(M) rape survivor looking for a feminist perspective. Trying to recover from a difficult situation.," Trigger warning\*

I'm   posting this here because in my experience my female friends have been   more understanding of my situation and have had more experiences that   may run parallel to my own than I typically see in my male friends.  I   apologize for the length in advance.

I'm   30 years old, and around 4 years ago I went on date with a woman I had   met online.  We hit it off immediately and seemed to have everything  in  common.  Everything was going smoothly.  The only complication was  that  she was partially blind from type 1 diabetes.  As a result, she  lived  with her dad and could only drive during certain times of the  day.  With  my work schedule that meant the only way we could see each  other was if  I drove to her Dad's house.

Initially,   that wasn't a problem.  I would come over after work, and her I were   really hitting it off.  After about three weeks however, her dad and   stepmom decided I couldn't come over at night like that anymore.   The   stepmom decided we were being a bad influence on her younger daughter   because my GF (27 yo) and I were having sex.  They told me I could come   over during the day, but my job meant I could not.  Things had been   going so well, that I told the woman I was seeing that she could just   come stay at my house for a while.

At   first this was fine.  After about a week of staying there, she was ready   to introduce me to her  mom who lived out of town.  About two days   after talking about meeting her, her mom died suddenly.  My GF did not   take it well at all.

Of course, that in   it's self was not abnormal.  But that is when the abuse began.  She was   very angry, and on the way to the funeral she began to take it out on   me.  This was the first time she had been like that, so I didn't think   much of it.   After all, her mom had just tragically and suddenly died.

However,   the dynamic continued for weeks after the funeral.  It had begun to   affect our sex life, as I was not happy about being verbally abused.    However, I was determined to be there for her.

At   the time I sold insurance for a living, and was trying to save up  money  to go back to school.  I was offered work in a particular  insurance  enrollment that had great pay, but had absolutely brutal  hours.  They  had told me I would have to wake up before dawn and that  many nights by  the time I got home it would time to go to bed and do it  all again.  It  only was for a month, and I needed the money, so I  accepted.

However,  I worried about the  effect it would have on mine and my gf's new  relationship, particularly  because of the loss of her mom and the fact  that we were fighting.   But we talked and we both agreed that we needed  the money.  We talked  about the fighting and (I thought) put it all  behind us.  She  apologized for how she had been treating me.

Now,   an important bit of information:  I have a spinal injury that can be   very painful.  Particularly when I'm forced to sit in a car all day.  At   the time I was taking benzos during the day and Ambien at night to   sleep (both prescribed).

Unfortunately,   the fighting continued and got worse while I did this job.  Looking   back, I think it was hard for my gf to be in such a new environment   alone all day while I worked, especially with the passing of her mom.    When I came home it was like she been ruminating all day, and the   fighting persisted.  I would come home with terrible back pain, and that   combined with her being mean, there were many times I wasn't feeling   like having sex.

One such night, we were   both in bed after I had taken an Ambien.  I had to be up at 4 am the   next day.  She wanted to have sex and I didn't, so at first nothing   happened even she was not happy about it.  She was about a foot shorter   than me, and couldn't have physically forced me.  What she did however,   was wait until I was almost asleep from the Ambien and then woke me  up.   She asked me for sex again and I said no.  She kept waking me up  every  time I would almost nod off.  She did  this until eventually she  told me  the only way I was going to sleep was if we had sex.  After a  few hours  of this, I gave in.  It wasn't like I was not attracted to  her, I just  didn't want to.

I was mad  the next day,  and we talked about it.  She realized what she did wasn't  cool and  promised it wouldn't happen again.  It did though.  Many  times.  One  night I tried to resist and got no sleep at all.  The next  day trying to  drive I nearly drove off the road from sleep deprivation,  which was  when I first started to realize I was being raped.

The   abuse got worse.  She became increasingly verbally abusive and   physically abusive.  During some of these fights she would blockade me   in a room, throwing herself in front of the door when I would try to   leave.  I eventually wanted her out of my home.  But her dad turned out   to be a real asshole, and wouldn't let her move back in.  She had   nowhere to go, as (perhaps due to this type of behavior) none of her   friends would take her in either.  I began to feel trapped.  There were   times when the abuse got bad, and I would threaten to call the police.    This escalated things even further.  She told me she was going to hurt   herself before they got there, and that she would tell them I was   responsible.  I had a family member who at the time was selling   contraband, and she told me she would tip the DEA off to it.  She had   control over me, and over the next year drove me insane.  I couldn't   have even kicked her out into the street if I wanted to, because with   brittle diabetes she needed to keep insulin refrigerated and whatnot.

It   finally resolved when I tried to kill myself.   I texted something   about it to my brother who contacted my dad.  He showed up and kicked   down the door and found me in my bathroom with a gun in my mouth.    Obviously, I didn't do it.  I wanted to though.   At that point, he   stepped in and paid for her to get a hotel and contacted family she had   in Colorado.  He helped me to get her moved out.

After   finding myself alone in my home again, I began to realize the degree  to  which that the experience had changed me mentally.  I could no  longer  continue to work in my sales job, and as such enrolled back into  college  as I had planned, studying electrical engineering (hoping a  job  involving less person to person interaction would be easier).  I  sought  therapy at my university, and after a year of speaking with a   psychologist, I was diagnosed with PTSD.

It's   now been 4 years since I met her and 3 years since I got her out of my   life. . .  School has been ok.  I'm on track to graduate in a couple  of  years.

Mentally however, I feel like  I've  never really recovered.  I haven't been able to date.  I try, but  when  things start to get physical I get incredibly anxious.  It seems  like  many of the women here are just looking for something fun, and  there's  nothing fun about rape related PTSD, and I can't blame anyone  for that.   It also seems that as soon as some people hear that I am a  survivor of  abuse they immediately assume that because I'm a man, I  must have been  the abuser and be lying.  Or they just don't think women  can rape men.   Which I honestly understand that too.  The vast  majority of the time it  is the man.  But just because something is rare  doesn't mean it **never**   happens.   And it's hard, because I feel like I need to re-establish   some sort of healthy sex life to recover.  But I can't.  Or at least for   3 years I haven't been able to.

Some   days it just feels hopeless.  I guess today is one of those days.    Sometimes I feel like I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life, and   like I should have pulled the trigger the day I had a chance.  It just   doesn't seem to stop.

It  impacts my  relationships in general honestly.  My brother doesn't know  how to deal  with me now.  My dad flat out doesn't understand men can be  raped, and  thinks I'm this way for attention or something.

After   typing all of this, I feel like I don't even know why I have or what the point is.  Maybe just to get it off my chest. Or maybe to see if anyone's perspective can help me navigate all this. Sometimes it feels   like it never really happened and I just imagined it all, or like a bad   dream.  But it did happen.  And I don't know how to pick up the pieces   and move forward.  I feel lost.

241,Sex positive attitudes vs objectification,"I recently just got out of the ""anti-sjw skeptic"" quicksand pit, so I'm new to feminism, but I've been a sex positive person my whole life. 

My question concerns reconciling sex positive attitudes and objectification concerning fictional characters in media. 

In reality, my method of determining if something was objectification or not is dependant on things like Independence and consent. As in, a woman who chooses to wear revealing clothes isn't ""objectifying herself"" because she chose to wear those clothes, hopefully because she genuinely likes the way she looks in them. 

Someone who is working at a coffee shop who has to wear a revealing uniform probably *is* being objectified because you can reasonably conclude that she wouldn't choose to wear that if she didn't need to keep a job.

That's way simplified but hopefully makes sense. But with fictional characters I'm totally stumped. 

If someone told me ""ivy from soul Calibur is demeaning"" I feel like I COULD respond ""well, what if ivy just loves to show off? Shouldn't she be allowed to?"" However that response feels very disingenuous. Yet I can't logically refute it.

So my question to you folk is how can we tell?

242,Why Are Feminists So Angry?,"Anecdotally, this is a common quality I've noticed here and elsewhere: a pervasive anger emanating from feminists as though rage has embodied every fiber of their being.

I wonder if it's related to the fact that feminists have aligned themselves with liberal ideology and statistics have shown that conservatives consistently report being happier than liberals.  (This phenomenon has been well documented since the 1970's).

245,Mega Anxiety when people criticize the Me Too movement,"Today I was “debating” with a good (male) friend of mine about the Me Too movement. Here are some of the silly points he brought up:

1. Women who wait 10+ years to come forward with accusations of sexual assault, without any evidence, are wrong to do that. There’s no way to prove it actually happened but the man’s life is ruined forever.

2. Because of Me Too, any time a man makes a pass at or touches a women, he can be accused of sexual assault. There’s no way to interact with women now or try to date without it possibly be taken offensively.

3. Men are pigs and always have been. He’s worked at places where men were slapping his ass and making sexual jokes. It’s just part of their nature and nothing will change that. 

4. That media was the biggest problem of all because they blow up every little incident or demonize the man when there is no evidence. 

5. And in general feminism.. women say they want equality (like equal pay) but then want to be “pampered” with things like maternity leave. 

He of course clarified that he is 100% against rape. And unfortunately.. I have had convos with other men, who I consider to be good people, who hold these beliefs as well. It’s like they get so defensive and focus in on the small percentage of men that get wrongly accused. And then mid-conversation they suddenly turn into lawyers who are experts in sexual assault cases. Sigh.

Anyways. Anytime anyone talks about the MeToo movement I just want to crawl out of my skin. I start shaking, my stomach starts swirling, and my brain gets so foggy I can barely think. I was on the verge of tears while I was talking to my friend. Does this happen to anyone else? I know it must be PTSD-related, but it’s so frustrating because I can’t adequately get my point across. 

Some of the things I said...

1. Women who have been sexually assaulted have the right to speak their truth whenever they are ready whether they have evidence or not. 

2. He seems to be putting down the movement because of the harm it causes to the small percentage of men who are wrongly accused. Why is he focused on viewing these men as victims instead the 90-99% of victims who are telling the truth. 

3. Men may be pigs, but that doesn’t mean that women need to accept their behavior.

4. His views are in fact misogynistic (he disagrees) 

I feel like my responses are so...common sense. I wish I could articulate myself as well as some of the authors of articles I’ve read on the subject. What more can I say if I find myself in another convo like this? Any great articles you can recommend are appreciated.

249,Just dropping by this sub to ask a question.,"What wave of feminism do you personally support? I'm not going to pretend I'm terribly educated on Feminism, but from some basic things I've gathered (correct me if I'm wrong), 1st wave feminism was more focused on voting rights, and women rights in general, to be able to eliminate (or at the very least reduce) discrimination, primarily in the workplace and in the opportunities presented to women. 

3rd/4th wave is, from what I've gathered, more of equality of outcome, the gender pay gap, and trying to mitigate discrimination and bring attention to rape &amp; sexual assault in the workplace and otherwise. 

I don't know much about 2nd wave feminism, but it seems like most feminists identify themselves as either 1st wave, or 3rd/4th wave.

Me:  abortion is bad ecause the fetus is a human being, not a parasite. A 2-month old baby is a parasite for all intents and purposes.

It eats off mommy's milk, depends on mommy for everything, can't move unless mommy carries it around, mommy even changes diaper and accompanies to doctor to keep alive!!

can you kill it?

And it's not a group of tissues, if two ladies came to crying, one of them, her husband forced her to cut nails or shave hair. (No autonomy here)

The other, her husband forced her to abort her kid! Are the two incidents morally equivalent?

Both husbands suck. But it the same sympathy?

If a prison forces abortion, is it the same as a prison forcing nail cuts?

12,"I have a question about the paper ""WHITE PRIVILEGE AND MALE PRIVILEGE"" by Peggy McIntosh ...","
In the work ""WHITE PRIVILEGE AND MALE PRIVILEGE: A PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF COMING TO SEE CORRESPONDENCES THROUGH WORK IN WOMEN’S STUDIES"", there are numerous references to ""unearned advantage"" when referencing white men. What is an ""unearned advantage""? What is an ""earned advantage""?

https://nationalseedproject.org/white-privilege-unpacking-the-invisible-knapsack

I've also read ""Unpacking the Invisible Backpack"", and it s full of similar language - I have gone through the list and disagree with her methodology. Most of what she is describing can be attributed to the advantage of being wealthy, or living in an area where you are part of the majority culture (which is not inherently racist because then every culture would be racist depending on how they treat minorities from other countries, in which case it isn't white privilege but majority privilege). There are maybe half a dozen advantages she describes in each list that can be attributed to racism, but her methodology is anecdotal. She is not showing any data to support her findings, and some of her statements have actually been contradicted by some recent research.

14,"U.S. Department of Justice disagrees with 1 in 5 statistic, provides more accurate number","Disclaimer: percentages I'm mentioning may be off slightly, as they're originally reported separated between students and non-students, and I may have screwed up the process of combining the percentages and rates. The original report has been linked to so you can check for yourself. I go over some of the statistics I found most surprising/intriguing. 

According to [this](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf) report, by Lynn Langton and Sofi Sinozich, the total percentage of college age women (18-24) from all types of sexual assault (including threats) is a cumulative 1.73% (combining non-students and students), or roughly 1 in 50 (rounding up) from the time of 1995 to 2013. Only 6% are said to occur on school-grounds, although they're uncertain about the accuracy due to how low the instances of it being recorded as having occurred (reported or documented in some way). 

Around 80% of all sexual assault is committed by someone known, with only 1-2% being those related to the victim, 50% of all being by someone casually known, and about 25% being significant others. About half of all perpetrators were visibly under the influence, one quarter weren't sure, and the final quarter appeared sober. Most were between 20 and 30 years old. 

More students didn't report the crimes to the police than non-students, with 20% being reported by students and a little over 30% being reported by non-students, leaving a staggering 70-80% not reported, with fortunately a nearly nonexistent amount being advised to not report it, doing so for a wide variety of reasons.

Unfortunately only 1 in 5 victims have actually received support (as in by agencies that either are designed to or are a subset that are designed to help victims of sexual assault).

The city is also safer than rural areas, with the rate being about 9/1000 or 0.9% vs in-city being 5/1000 or 0.5%. Although this may be affected by population distribution to cause this appearance.

To me, adopting seems more responsible if there are so many children that need adopting, or are unable to be raised by their parents. Also the woman doesn't have to go through 9 months of physical stress, culminating in an extremely painful birth.

However, I don't actually know if when women choose to bear their own children, how many of them do so because of external pressure as opposed to internal desire.

25,The goal of feminism,"Allow me to state before I pose my question that I am a man. I was raised in a single parent environment by my mother with one younger sister. I had no male role models growing up. My family comes from an incredibly poor working class background and yet my mother managed to drag us up out of the dirt and instil morals and an education that has enabled me to attain my ‘dream job’. My experience with women has been wholly positive, until I started to become aware of the modern feminism movement.

My question is, what is the goal of feminism, is it to bring total equilibrium between the sexes, or is it to reverse the rolls where women are the dominant sex and men become ‘second class citizens’ 

My reason for asking is that a lot of what I read and see in daily life advocates a reasoning that because of something that used to be and happen to women, and  that men are the enemy.  That they deserve bad things simply for being men. 

To me, this kind of thinking is not one of equality and is detrimental to future generations and I am genuinely curious as to what feminists think the final outcome is with their movement.

Ps I am not saying this is the case for all, but with most movements you have moderate and extremist views. This is legit a question as to what the ideal end to the movement is.

34,What do you mean when you say someone feels entitled to sex?,"With all the attention incels have been getting I've seen a lot of the accusation that they feel entitled to sex. I'm not disputing this but it sparked the question in my head as to what this means exactly.

I can see the obvious case where for example someone goes on a date and spends money and gets very pushy at the end thinking there is an implied agreement that because of their time and money having been spent they are owed sex. I would say entitlement in this sense is analogous to a contract which seems altogether innapropriate for sex. Is this all people mean when they talk of entitlement?

On the other hand with incels people also seem to take their despair about the lack of sex in their life to imply that they feel they deserve or are entitled to sex in the first sense. In my view this isn't the same type of entitlement as, similar to a job, one is never entitled to just demand it from whoever they want but it is still held up as a central part of life and having it denied throughout your life (even for just reasons) is a valid reason for despair. I'd like to focus only on this type of entitlement as I'm sure actual incels have said some crazy things about literally being entitled to sex. 

 In this latter way I would say nearly everyone feels entitled to sex, not in the sense that they have a valid claim on any individual but that they are taught by society to expect it and being denied it for long enough (along with the intimacy and validation often accompanying it) will cause a large amount of suffering.

 That's not to say that anyone owes them anything for their disappointment, but I think it's hypocritical to condemn incels for this type of entitlement (but fair for the others) when most of us also believe in it, the only difference between us and them being that we haven't been continually disappointed and so usually don't understand why someone would feel the right to complain.",AskFeminists,1541497605,Nine_Hostages,156,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9un0ww/what_do_you_mean_when_you_say_someone_feels/,2018-11-06

(And to keep things simple, let's say you can change your appearance, but you can't change your lifespan - an old person who changes to look young, will still die in a few years, etc.)



In such a future, what would happen to feminism?  Would the rights of people who ""choose"" to be female, matter as much, if anyone could opt out of being female?


I guess a more interesting question is, what would happen to patriarchy?  Would it disappear, because anyone can opt-in to those privileges?  Or would it become reinforced, such that ""you choose the body to match the role you want - kitchen or workplace.""

40,Some sincere questions regarding feminism,"I'm not here to attack, offend or criticize anyone, I actually came here because I'd want to know your viewpoints on some of these topics. I myself have always been more left-leaning but all my life for me it has been important to question my views and ideas. There has been a lot more fuzz around the feminist movement in the past few months (or years) and that has raised a lot of questions in me. So I'd love to get some of your opinions about them. 

1. Do you think we live in a patriarchy? If yes, how so? What privileges do you think a white male has over someone of a different gender/race? Are some of the privileges defined by law/constitutional? Or are they just societal?

2. On r/feminism I saw a comment with many upvotes saying that some men suffer from patriarchy aswell, but also say ""bro, you guys built that shit"". Do feminists feel that the average man of today is responsible or has taken part in a social construct that has been around for centuries? Is it right to categorize people through their gender/race and make them feel guilty for what the same race might have done before?

3. Why do you think women get on average less salary than men? How do you think facts like: men work longer hours, men are more likely to work in dangerous jobs and men are more likely to study a major that has a higher-earning future affect the wage gap? Why do you think there aren't as many female CEO's?

4. What do you define as hate speech and where do you determine the line between free speech and hate speech?

5. What do you think about religions?

6. How would you define toxic masculinity if there's such a thing? Is there toxic femininity?

7. Why do you think sexual harrasment towards men isn't (always) taken as seriously? 

8. Why do you think feminism gets so much hate nowadays? Wouldn't you think most of the people in this world support equality? 

9. What do you think are the (major) biological differences between men and women? Do you think they should be considered when planning a society and a better tomorrow?

46,What are your opinions on welfare payments that incentivise work?,"I'm doing a write-up for a project I'm working on and would love some insight or perspectives that I might have not considered.

Context:

* In 2004, Labour (centre-left) introduced a welfare scheme where families are incentivised to get back into work using tax credits. There are 4 different types which allow all families to receive enough money to survive, but give extra tax credits to parents who go back into the workforce
* In 2011, National (centre-left) put this on steroids and introduced 'jobseeker benefit' which means they must be applying for jobs and must accept any offers (this incl. jobs which require drug testing, so must abstain while receiving welfare). They're also not allowed to move to areas with low employment opportunities. **Also**, they tightened obligations for sole parents - they must have part time work by the time their youngest turns 5. If they have another child while on the benefit then this reduces to age 1, to disincentivise having children on the benefit. 

From a feminists perspective, what is the **main** critiques or praises of these two policies?

52,What is your opinion one three videos by YouTuber Counter Argument on Listen and Believe and Online Harassment.,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YVy3EnOrfok

Listen And Believe

&gt;Published on May 2, 2018
&gt;Argument: If somebody (especially a woman) claims to have been wronged (harassed/raped/etc.), believe that the accusation is true; it most likely is.

&gt;Counter-Argument: Believing claims blindly negates the need for evidence and will inevitably result in innocent people being found guilty; statistical probability is irrelevant.

&gt;Arguer's Fault: Non sequitur and naïveté.

67,Opinions on a tangled sex encounter/consent/rape?,"1. A man is determined to be intersex at birth. Has the male genitalia, but is given a woman's name and is raised as a girl.  
  
2. Temporarily uses female hormones as a young teen, becoming very feminine in appearance.  
  
3. In his adult life says that has ''never felt like a girl'', in his private life (among family and friends) takes on a male first name and male pronouns. Keeps his legal female name and pronouns in public life.  
  
4. Meets a gay woman. Begins to date her using his female name, not disclosing anything about his biological sex or gender identity, is believed to be female.  
  
5. Has sex with said woman. Hides his own genitalia, says that he does not like to be touched and prefers to use a dildo instead, held between his legs.  
  
My question is - is this rape by deception or not? It would seem so to me, as the woman in question believes that she is having sex with both a biological female and a woman identified person. But I've heard opinions that because he used his legal name and pronouns that were often used for him (both female), and because the woman had consented to have sex with said dildo, then there has been no deception involved and it is fully consensual sex.",AskFeminists,1541633502,AcceptableTourist_,29,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9v4o3d/opinions_on_a_tangled_sex_encounterconsentrape/,2018-11-07

85,Do you ever think that some women can alienate men who may be feminist?,"I'll preface by saying this is going to be a sort of mishmash of thought as opposed to some well thought out structured 'essay', so prepare for some verbal word salad if you care to continue.

I'm a feminist male (I think) and I have to say it's a somewhat socially difficult, I'd like to talk about things I've noticed.  I'm not saying it's fact, but my own anecdotal observations.

Stating I am a feminist gets strange looks.  I think the word in itself brings up so much controversy.

It might be a strange thing to start with, but in my romantic life and dating life (not single now), but in the past, stating I am a feminist got awkward looks.  I could notice a change in mood from women.  An awkwardness.

As a social experiment I opened a tinder account and I would get many matches.  One day the ONLY thing I changed was stating I was a feminist, this lead to get zero matches.

I went on a date with a woman and mention I am a feminist, and it brought up a feeling of uncomfortably.

In some sense, I feel women don't really want to think of their man as a feminist.  I think they mistake the word to mean a male exhibits feminine traits.  I often hear ""I want my man to be a man"".

Please don't take my intention wrong.  This isn't about my frustration in the dating world, it is my frustration in having it difficult to me a male who is a feminist.

Secondly, do you feel that Instagram vanity accounts contribute to objectification of women?  I know many men that are on Instagram and they subscribe to many woman accounts who simply just show their ass, or flaunt their bodies.  They are looking to objectify themselves.

You often see feminist movements ridiculing men for objectifying women.  And I'm not talking about saying women who are just walking down the street wearing a short skirt.  In that sense, she wants to look good for herself or others.  No one knows if she's trying to draw attention to herself, in that sense, it's simply wrong to objectify. 

But these vanity accounts seem to be created for the sole purpose of objectifying themselves.  Would you not say this is a very heavy contributor in hindering this movement?

I also find many movements or dialog to alienate men who are already on their side.  There always seems to be this harsh push towards men.  The problem is, they are pushing against men who are already likely not willing to listen.

Feminism is more about 'humanism' if I""m not mistaken.  It's about equality.  But the word has such a controversial and misunderstand of it's definition.  It has a 'bad rap' in my opinion.  Do some of you believe it would be more beneficial to get into the spot light of helping men where they are discriminated against?  Perhaps the unintended result of that would be getting men on board with this movement and breath understanding into it again.

  
I'm trying to understand these dynamics to become more educated, this is my reason for this post.  I want to hear the viewpoints of feminist women.  Of course I'll make mistakes along the way.

93,How does patriarchy affect incels?,"Hi everybody! I'm a former incel and I left the incel community a while ago. I'm not going to pretend that I'm a ""good"" man now because I'm still working on my misogyny but for the most part I've changed for the better. I'm a feminist ally at best (because I don't believe that I'm well educated in feminism) and I want to help both incels and women across the world by promoting positive masculinity among incels. Many incels like to blame women for their problems when they don't realize that our patriarchal society is the cause of many of their problems. I've read a couple of the older threads here about incels and I agree that they need to break out of that echo chamber, which is exactly what I did to escape the community. 

I want to learn more from feminists or male feminists if possible about how patriarchy affects incels. Right now I only know the basics (suicide rates, male socialization and isolation, expected to conform to society's expectations of a ""man"", never pushing for body positivity, hiding emotions, etc.).

113,"Would it help turn around budding red pillers, if women asked more men out?","I'm a man who was too shy to talk to women, let alone ask them out. I feel it was possible I could have fallen to their ranks when i was younger, but what if significantly more women asked men out? Is it possible some of those men who becomes resentful, may have found happiness instead and supported the cause of feminism?

There is much my gender can do and should do to improve the situation, and I well do everything I can on that front, but meanwhile I feel like if we teach boys, but ALSO girls to be more affirmative, then we can greatly reduce the number of men going down that dark spiral.

This idea isn't coming from someone who's had a simple innocent life and I'll give that context next...

Some personal context. I'm a dude who cares a lot about feminism, for example I love Soldat's book ""Men explain things to me"" although admittedly some of her essays were too dense in meaning for me to finish.

When i was a teenager, I was sort of an incel. I was in great shape, star of the basketball team, Good group of nerdy friends, I think i was moderately funny, but I was awkward as all hell with women, very insecure, and frankly I was too scared of being considered a creep to properly interact with women.

I had a girlfriend who cheated on me in highschool and even went so far as to have sex with someone else while we were sleeping over at someone else's place... I thought we were too young (15), or that it would be inappropriate for me to do such a thing at someone else's place (Plus she appeared to have some serious psychological issues, so I didn't want to be the guy taking advantage of her, even if I was her boyfriend). After that event I definitely felt resentment that other boys were getting something while being pushy (or ya know, just taking some initiative), that I wasn't getting. Later I had another girlfriend, I lost my virginity and frankly that was a good time in my life, but I was still frustrated that the few really interest/smart girls I had ever met weren't dating me (most of them were gf's of my friends, of course of the ones that weren't, I was NOT asking them out, because I was too damn shy, despite my jovial personality). I then did a degree in computer science, and you can imagine how many women were around during that, needless to say, I was frustrated again, fortunately I knew it was a numbers game and I needed to simply be around more women, one way or another. After that I found lots of friends, but they were all gamers \[and of course men\], I'm sure you know how toxic environments like game stores are for women, so few women there. Frustrated again, I moved to online dating, but few women would respond to me \[I later realized the deluge of spam women have to deal with\]. Fortunately, I was getting better at talking to women at this point and being more forward with my intentions to get to know them better. It wasn't much longer before I met my current girlfriend and after 4 years of amazing communication, I imagine we'll be together for a very long time. From my story, I hope you can see the many ways so many men might fall prey to cults like Peterson's.

I'm now in my early 30s and have gotten over those issues. I have a long term girlfriend and feel very comfortable around women, more so than some of my male friends. I feel I have a unique perspective as someone who loathes the behaviour of TRP and MRA, yet was very close to becoming one. If you're curious of my opinion on anything, given my perspective, feel free to ask. Also if you know of good feminism material that would relate to what I went through, or to help me fix my understanding of things, please let me know!

Random tidbit, my strongest feelings of feminism are against toxic masculinity. IMO if we teach boys right at a young age, most feminism issues well likely be resolved once they grow up, but this is just conjecture from me.

I guess I also feel like this growing incel issue is because of how few women are involved in various activities. I loved video games, board and card games, I was into programming. These things are all things many women enjoy, but as I understand it they are pushed out of it, because of toxic masculinity. Frankly, I'm not sure what came first, a lack of women, or toxic masculinity, because I know some of it comes from incels who are frustrated BECAUSE of the lack of women. I know many of them who if they just interacted with more women, they would definitely find someone, because they were nice and interesting... but they were stuck in nothing but all men crowds and didn't realize the trap they were in.

Sorry, I had to post this, because I feel like I've had a bit of a person revelation as to where a lot of misogyny and sexism comes from, at least from my set of communities.

118,What can be done to help quell the uprising of toxic masculinity?,"Trump and Peterson are signs that adult men are getting worst.  


Feminism does great things to influence future generations and give good impressions on adolescents and teens, and parents, but there is a crowd of men that have spiralled into the cults of Peterson and such.  


I'm just wondering if anyone had ideas of how to help steer men off that path. I personally argue with them about how horrible Peterson is, but it's hard to show them the flaws in his logic, especially considering they tend to use his same tactics to ignore my advice. I want to believe there aren't millions of men that are simply lost... there must be ways to help them.  


I throw out a random small idea, at game stores where toxic masculinity is high, have geeky events run by and themed by women, and advertise only to women, BUT don't make it women only, just don't tell them men. Try and get attendance up, by a new free atmosphere, then as the event gets more popular and men start to realize it's occurring they start joining, but of course there is a zero tolerence policy, so men can't act toxic, and any that do are overwhelmed by the women, until hopefully, they learn to act appropriately around women, and that specific game store is saved! Further dozens of men are on the road to being respectful to women, and perhaps even feminists one day.  


Anyways I'm looking for ideas big or small, currently, I feel like it's hopeless.

119,"Your thoughs on ""Manspreading"" and ""Mansplaining"" ?","Ok. So, i've seen that manspreading/splaining was THE thing everyone talked about some times ago. Now that everything has cooled down, and now that it's not THE trendy thing everybody talks about, i'd like to hear your opinion.

I will be 100% honest and tell you what I think about it (as a man):  


\-Manspreading: I do agree that man taking multiple places at once with their legs is an issue. However, it is not an issue of ""Male wanting do dominate the area"" or something: it is simply a lack of education: those are just people who think that is ok to take two places instead of one. I think that does not only concern mens: I've seen many women taking one or two extra seats to place their bags, when they could have simply put the bag on their lap.  
Also: when a man sits with open legs, but that doesn't take more space that it should: why caring ? It is uncomfortable to most mens to close their legs, so be it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Mansplaining: I can clearly see some men interrupt women, but again, in a few cas that might be beacuse of sexism; however, if i disagree with an opinion, or if someone says something that is factually incorrect, I may interrupt that person. That is not exclusive to men.

120,Do you think there can be room in the world for people like this (example in post)?,"For those who don't follow the world of pro-wrestling, there was a recent story about a wrestler, Randy Orton, being investigated for a rib he would play on the new writers in years past, which involved walking in with his hand on his crotch, and then going to shake the hand of the writer. If the writer hesitated, he'd go something like, ""What, you too good to shake my hand?"" or something like that.

Personally, I find that kinda funny. If he did that to me, I could handle it, and wouldn't consider it a huge deal, or a violation of my person or the like. Just a rib from a jocular guy who endures beatings 200 nights a year, and ribs a little harder than some. That's life, and something to laugh about in retrospect.

I also think there is, or at least should, be a place in the world for people who also find that funny, and like to interact and grow personal bonds with others through ribs and gags and like that. But it often seems like that kind of thing is no longer allowed to exist anywhere.

Old-school wrestling personality Jim Cornette commented on the story on his podcast which you can listen to [here](https://youtu.be/9nnQV5gV_44). You can get a clear sense of his attitude about it (""If you wanna be in the f**kin wrestlin' business, and you're surprised when one of the boys f**ks with you, then you don't need to be in the wrestlin' business. Your f**kin' feelings are too f**kin' fragile."") And perhaps you might also get a sense of his affection and love for the business as well, and the joy and nostalgia with witch he talks about being part of the kind of environment. 

For me, I wonder if there are people in the world who just want to live that way, and conversely might be miserable in too sterilized an environment, which you could argue is what modern sensibilities and rules creates. So, is there a place in the world for them? Should there be?

125,"How is it acceptable to push for gender-specific domestic and sexual violence legislation, or gender-specific food aid?","When feminists push for intiatives for men, they are usually in the form of groups for equal custody or mental health initiatives.

However, initiatives for women that deny men much-needed protection are often championed by feminists, like women-only domestic and sexual violence laes or gender-specific food aid.

Why is it, that when men are disadvantaged, gender-specific initiatives are aimed at them only when excluding women does not subject them to extreme circumstances, but women-only intiatives such as gender-specific domestic and sexual violence legislation and food aid in third world countries are fine?

These were guys who were expelled from college, and were considered that they assaulted sexually the women.

&amp;#x200B;

1) A student and a girl were in a room. After a party, they didn't know each other well. He touched her private parts and there was vaginal penetration with his fingers. Both parties agree that he asked and got verbal consent.  He said ""do you like this"" and she said yes and she faked an orgasm. He was found responsible for sexualy assault because she said ""I didn't mean it, I said yes I was enjoying it in order to get away with it faster, I wanted a graceful way to leave his room, and I thought making him think that I was having an orgasm would help me get out of it more gracefully without being rude"".

2) A student who is a black guy, six feet tall and very muscular. It is undisputed that they were in her bedroom together to  hook up. That they took all of their clothes and she touched his genitals and performed oral sex on him. And she said that she did that because she was fearful, once they were both naked. That the situation was so overwhelming that she felt she had to reach out and touch him and then reach out and use her mouth on him. And the school decided in that situation that the only thing that got wrong is that there wasn't a verbal confirmation.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Various encounters were my students had. Were both agree that they were having consensual intercourse. They both agree that the consent was withrawn during the intercourse and that the intercourse stopped. The dispute is about how rapidly stopped.

142,"What is a good way to quantify ""soft"" examples of societal sexism?","People argue that there isn't societal sexism because everyone can vote, own property, go into any career they want, etc. but this ignores all of the less measurable issues that prevent the equality from happening.

Examples:

* Assuming a female medical student wants to go into pediatrics or unsolicited advice on what specialty to go into if they are going to get pregnant.
* Weightlifting advice assuming the reader is male.
* Role models/prominent people in certain fields being predominately men
* Toy choice when children
* Pink tax (e.g makeup) and consequences if you choose to refuse to partake in such products

The effects of these things are significant but its much harder to prove that it's sexism since it's not ""official"" sexism such as lack of suffrage and can just be dismissed as individual choices.

As someone who agrees with a lot of the legal movements behind feminism but doesn't quite understand the full stance of feminism in media I'm curious what the opinion of a character like Big Mom is.

On one hand Charlotte Linlin (the character's real name) is one of the most powerful characters in the setting both in power and rank. She also draws power from being a woman without being a femme fatalle by being the mother to children who inherited her strength. She was also too powerful for the main protagonist to defeat in her own arc and instead the big fight was against her number one subordinate. On the other hand, the big fight of her arc was against her strongest son and she probably won't be the ending fight of any future arcs. She's also the only woman of her rank and probably, by story tropes and beats, the weakest of her rank. 

So I'm curious, is Big Mom a good example of a strong female character or is she just another massive stereotype?",AskFeminists,1542112286,ultralink22,3,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9wonm5/what_is_the_feminist_perspective_of_big_mom_from/,2018-11-13

Direct reports who are women might flirt but I can easily shut them down and that’s the end of it.

However, my peers are a huge problem. Women colleagues very, very often overtly flirt with me or are standoffish when I don’t flirt back in kind. I have platonic friendships with a few women colleagues but they are almost all married. This is very different from my relationships with colleagues who are men — there is no expectation that we are anything but coworkers and almost never any flirtation (maybe if they are gay, but it’s less aggressive than with women).

178,"What can I, a slightly misogynistic, autistic guy, look at/read into to help with my glitches?","Hello, /r/AskFeminists! I'm low-key crazy excited to read your responses to this thread. 

The reason I'm asking this hella overdone question is because a *lot* of feminist literature relies on a lot of emotional knowledge and maturity, and while I'm gaining on those two fronts I'm always gonna be 5 years behind due to the fact that I have autism. I don't really feel like it's acceptable to be acting like a 25-year-old around really anything if I have no excuse, and I'm reaching the point in my life where I'm tired of fighting and *actually* want the best for everyone and not just the people who are like me. Having that realization means I have no excuse left.

As so much feminist literature is emotional by its very nature, I find a lot of it doesn't resonate with me. I'm not an emotionless android but it's difficult to appeal to my emotions unless I'm really behind the cause. I'm not asking for dry statistics either, but those are always welcome for me! I love hard data. Something with a lively voice that's more factual than emotional would be ideal. 

If anyone's curious about my specific glitches, I've identified a few of them and am willing to talk about them if it's relevant in any way.

180,Non-verbal consent - An unnecessary risk?,"Communication is the most key factor of consent. Without communication, there is no consent.

A month ago, I posted of an incident where, when I was 17, I accidentally had my arm resting against my girlfriend's breasts when we were cuddling. Years down the road, I got worried that she had felt violated. We keep in contact, so I asked her, and she informed me that she had enjoyed it.

I was informed by this sub that her not pushing me away or appearing uncomfortable after the initial accidental touch was non-verbal consent.

However, this concept seems rather unreliable.

For instance, what of a case where a guy misreads a woman and, though she may not show it, she feels uncomfortable?

It seems to me that non-verbal consent can at times come down to not being an assault out of pure luck and should, in most relationships, never be used. Or at all, for that matter.

I know of a woman in my own life who's long-time boyfriend had touched her breasts without permission. Despite having sex multiple times, she still felt assaulted.

I myself had not gotten too sexual before in my story, but they had. I wasn't the one who committed assault. In seems in these cases, it came down to the luck of the woman actually enjoying it.

A friend of mine has a 16-year old son and, long story short, some people close to him are worried that he might have internalised some toxic sexism or misogynistic attitudes towards women. I don't know the full details, but basically we were wondering if there might be any good books or other media out there which could help and massive bonus points if its not just about patriarchy and sexism but also about, kind of, ""finding yourself"" for teenagers. It's a difficult time for anyone, but complicating the situation is that he is trans and no one is really sure to what extent, if any, his gender identity plays out in his attitudes towards women. We're worried that he might not totally be on board with a general book about sexism if it seems like its aimed mainly at women or teenage girls, for example, but we also can't deny that he has probably had experiences in childhood which other teenage boys won't have.

First, we need to call out everything and everyone reinforcing the idea of men as 'disruptive innovators' versus women as just ... well ... disruptive.  (Oh, and don't forget to Smile, ladies!  Boys will be boys!) 
Then we can work on all those sticky power structures.

Women, on the whole, take on way too much responsibility for supporting, stabilizing, and sometimes just ••absorbing•• men's emotions -- all too often a literally thankless job.  (...Thank you, ladies.)
Imagine if political or corporate governance were rooted in that same 'emotional overtime'.  Oh, and, imagine replacing the rampant excesses (and itchy trigger fingers) of our current political and capitalist class with that same self-effacing nurturance.

...Imagine.  The future, as female.

I submit that many modern feminist goals, while well-intentioned, are just mortgaging that future for the sake of an 'equality' that's little more than cosmetic.

Thoughts, please.

187,Question about violent sexuality and feminism,"Hi, im sorry if i use offensive words but i dont know how to say it.

I am a 36yo guy, and i noticed that the ""more"" my sexual partners labeled themself feminist in their social life, the more they ask for violent sex at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I always asked them why they want that, what are their motivations, and the recuring phrases were:

\- When i go home, and i had to be strong all day, i just  want someone to take control.

Or with the two most militantic i met:

\- I want to feel like sexually abused, but because i ask it im the one in control.

Im not sure i want to tell what they wanted because i think its psychologically and physically very rough.

I started to ask them if they know why they want verbal and physical abuse. Its almost always because a childhood trauma. 

Now  if sexuality or feminisme is a topic in a discussion, i always ask some questions and  sometimes they tell me:

\- Its true that my best friend or ex or else, she is a very proactive feminist, and has this kind of sexuality.

&amp;#x200B;

English is not my native language so i hope you understand that i may not have used the words correctly.

I would like to know if my experiences are just coincidences.

Thank you very much.

200,Is the request for bald vaginas a sexist one in western nations?,"For the first time in my 28 years of life, I attempted to completely remove my cute golden blonde pubic hair. I spent a pretty long time, slowly and carefully, shaving away the hairs so that I could obtain a truly bald look. Afterwards, I felt a bit naughty...not to mention naked. Yet right the next day, I regretted doing this because not only did I feel too exposed or vulnerable, but also I felt as if I was trying to resemble a child of 11. Consider the fact that I'm only 4 feet 9 inches tall...and on top of that I had a bald vagina. I really did feel as if I was trying to resemble a child. Consequently, shaving my pubic hair did NOT make me feel ""sexy"" as an adult woman. I quickly missed my warm, protective hair. I normally keep it trimmed short so that it looks neater, so that it looks reasonable in others' eyes, but there is still plenty of hair on top. I've always accepted my pubic hair being there.

But when I google search things related to this topic, I find pages and pages of people, especially young men, expressing their irrational hatred for pubic hair on women. They seem to truly fear it. They basically grew up watching internet porn. Most of them sound young, dumb, immature, poorly educated, and clueless. Just not my cup of tea...

Men or women over the age of 35 don't really care about pubic hair because when they were teenagers they did not have easy access to internet porn. The obsession with pubic hair mainly exists among those who are under the age of 35. Young men are disillusioned by porn as they demand that ordinary women look like the best porn actresses. Young women feel the need to perform like porn actresses in the bedroom. Young minds are filled with porn. Even though I belong to the same generation that I'm bashing here, I don't feel bad or guilty in anyway. I have a strict sexual preference for men in their 40's because, as partners, they are better on almost all levels. I've had this preference since I was 21. Young men are just a turn off (for me, personally).

Back in July, my 42 year old lover was carrying me to bed when I told him that I hadn't trimmed my vagina hair in 6 weeks! I then told him to put me down. He said absolutely not. He said that he really didn't care about how bushy I'd gotten because he was very, very horny. He was being dominant in a non-threatening way which was super exciting. We had the hottest sex ever! Now imagine if he'd been the same age as me, 28, and put me down. Imagine if he'd reminded me to ""get rid"" of my vagina hair because it was supposedly ""gross"". Now he would have been controlling and narcissistic, implying that in order to be loved by him I would need to comply with his wishes, period.

You see although my 42 year old lover appreciates the fact that I keep my pubic hair trimmed short, he does not order me to do it. He has not made it a ""requirement"" in our relationship because that's when things turn abusive.

However, there are many women who feel immensely pressured to shave/wax their pubic hair. They don't want to be called ""gross"" or ""disgusting"" by their male partners or female friends. Men set the standards for beauty while women teach the standards to other women. ""This is what men want. This is what men prefer.""  Its all about men apparently.

So, then, is the request for bald vaginas a sexist one in western nations?

Personally, I want both men and women to have at least SOME hair covering their vagina/penis. The popular bald look is perverted if you ask me. We are attempting to revert back to being children by removing the hair which exaggerates our sexual maturity. In reality, some pubic hair is sexier than zero pubic hair.

222,"What does it mean for something to be ""empowering"" for a woman?","The way I have heard the term used before seems to fall into one of two approximate categories in my mind.

One is that something is empowering if it in some way objectively helps a woman achieve more power in society or at least more power over her own life. So this might for instance include achieving a position of authority, making a lot of money, learning self-defense, learning to be assertive etc. Then this would perhaps be sub-categorized into gaining power while adhering to feminist principles vs. gaining power by any means at all. For example making money in an ethical way vs. making money by pandering to misogynists. 

The second is that being empowered is a subjective experience. So for instance wearing makeup could be empowering, or engaging in a certain sexual activity could be empowering depending on the individual woman etc. So in this case being ""empowered"" is a subjective feeling? If you agree, how would you characterize the feeling? Are women talking about the same feeling using that word? 

I'm sorry for not being very articulate. I'm interested to hear what specifically you would define the concept of  ""empowering"" to be!

Peggy Carter was a well known, well respected character in the Marvel universe before her show began.  She worked on the super soldier program, she was *respected* by the men under her command, she was treated like an *equal* in Captain America.  As far as the story and its context goes, the fact that so many men could look at her and think ""Well, she's the boss"" is a statement intended to show how strong a *person* Carter was: Despite everything trying to hold her down she still rose to the top.  Can you imagine what would have happened if Steve Rogers had casually dropped a ""Hey sweetheart, how about you take those long legs over to the coffee pot and get me a fresh cup?""  Batman sound effects is what would have happened.  
  
Fast forward to the premier of the TV show and I'm excited AF.  No more of this damsel in distress bullshit, we're finally going to get a female character on TV that I *won't* have to watch being treated like shit for years on end.  She'll be like Phil Coulson: 1946 edition!  She'll be a strong character who's female, instead of a 'strong female character!'  Television is finally getting its shit together.  
  
Nope.  
  
So much nope.  
  
""Coffee, sweetheart?""  
""Why should I listen to a *girl!?""  
""Everybody keep Peggy safe, she's a lady.""  
""What does a woman like you know about the war?""  
  
Marvel kicked her in the eggs and made her a flat 2D caricature of every strong woman on TV.  Was she trusted?  Nope.  Was she respected?  Shit no.  Instead of empowering her the show actually made her weaker, smaller, less interesting.  If I want to watch a season of men treating women like shit I'll watch the Honeymooners, thanks, I want something *different.*  

If Carter comes back it needs to be as the kick-ass-and-take-names Agent from Captain America, not the mousy missus that Marvel TV made her into.  Give her strength, give her respect, tell a different story besides a woman fighting for the equality with her male peers, a character who doesn't *have* to prove herself, give us something to inspire and aspire to!  Carter needs more agency for an interesting story, not *less.*  

I know this is a strange thing to complain about, but the thing is that I am sick of seeing strong characters (almost always women) being made weak for the sake of the plot, and I feel like that's what happened to Peggy Carter.  
  
&gt;Dep: 
&gt;&gt;being made weak for the sake of the plot

&gt;You were right on the money until this.

&gt;She wasn't made weak for the sake of the plot, the plot was written in a way that makes her weak for the sake of the politics. They don't even realize that what you want--what a lot of us wanted--out of Peggy Carter, is what a feminist character actually looks like. Their idea--and truthfully, seemingly the idea held by many ""feminists"" today--is that a story is not a feminist one unless its protagonist faces misogynistic patriarchal opposition. So that's what they wrote.  
  
Me:  
It sounds like we're on the same page, yeah.  There's nothing wrong with telling the story of a woman's struggle in society, it has its place, I just felt like the whole point of Peggy Carter was that she had *already overcome that struggle.*

One of my favorite shows is The 100 on the CW, a story about the last surviving humans retaking the earth and rebuilding society. After the first season I was in love with the show, but it felt different and I didn't know why, then I realized what it was: The writers had left out gender politics almost entirely, which is a hell of a political statement in and of itself. It was beyond refreshing to see a vision of the world where gender and sexually really are presented as non issues. None of this ""You can't be the war chief, you've got *ovaries!""* bullshit. Nope, she killed the last war chief, so she's the new war chief, *as it should be.* 

Seeing someone struggle against the same thing we do can be empowering, can be inspiring, can lift a person up, but so can seeing a picture of a person who surpassed and overcame those challenges.

I don't know if it's politics, I'm a far left lefty liberal, theoretically the type of person this story would be aimed at, and I found it off putting...  Maybe now that MeToo has put a few more cracks in women's glass walls and ceilings we could see a stronger, more empowered Carter. 

Then again I'm a middle class white male, so it really could just be a matter of my perspective. It's not like I haven't been wrong a thousand times before.  
  
&gt;Dep:  
  
&gt;&gt; I don't know if it's politics, I'm a far left lefty liberal

&gt;I'm sorry, I didn't mean ""it's politics"" as in ""it's politics you disagree with"" but ""this is the only way in which Hollywood and certain audiences can absorb a feminist character. Every feminist story *has* to be about patriarchal struggle or they won't get that the lead is still an empowered woman.""

&gt;It's almost like romance novels. The story has to hit the expected beats in order to be considered ""liberal"" enough.  
  
(This is when my stomach got sour.)  
  
Me:  
I'm not sure I agree with your idea of the motivations, but the motivations are beside the point if the result is the same. 

I'd love to see writers focusing more on writing strong characters *who are female,* than in writing ""strong female characters.""  Women, just like men, are *people first.*  Write the person first.

I like his early work, though I've always been a little doubtful and uncomfortable with The Comfort of Strangers and Enduring Love, which have a tinge of gay panic about it. But in terms of the portrayal of women, nothing stood out to me as particularly egregious.
In his later works however, he seems to have developed a fair bit of a grudge against middle class educated women who choose not to have children. So specifically, The Children Act, which is written from the point of view of Fiona May, a female judge 59 years old. In the wake of her husband's declaration of infidelity, Fiona becomes insecure about her body, regrets her childlessness, and considers herself selfish for having chosen her career over giving life:
""Yes, her childlessness was a fugue in itself, a flight—this was the habitual theme she was trying now to resist—a flight from her proper destiny. Her failure to become a woman, as her mother understood the term. How she arrived at her state was a slow-patterned counterpoint played out with Jack over two decades, dissonances appearing, then retreating, always reintroduced by her in moments of alarm, even horror, as the fertile years slipped by until they were gone, and she was almost too busy to notice.""
""The music in her head had faded, but now came another old theme: self-blame. She was selfish, crabbed, drily ambitious. Pursuing her own ends, pretending to herself that her career was not in essence self-gratification, denying an existence to two or three warm and talented individuals. Had her children lived, it would have been shocking to think they might not have.""
""When she stood in the bathroom, when she stepped out of her pajamas, her body looked foolish in the full-length mirror. Miraculously shrunken in some parts, bloated in others. Bottom-heavy. A ridiculous package. Fragile, This Way Up. Why would anyone not leave her?""
The emphasis are mine.
As feminists, do you think these are plausible thoughts for a female judge to have, whether her husband is leaving her or not? I find that difficult to believe. Hypothetically, if Sonia Sotomayor found out her husband was cheating on her, would the above be the kind of thoughts that would go through her head?? If it's not obvious enough, the answer to me is obviously no. 
It's as if McEwan took one look at a powerful female judge, and all he could see was her body and the number of children she bore.

Bradly speaking, it the the domination of men in society and the power and control the exert over others. There is no matriarchy. The women dominated societies have never been found and recorded. Quoting from encyclopedia Britannica:

 ""The consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that while many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other, matriarchal societies in this original, evolutionary sense have never existed."" 

Feminists thinkers often like to attack patriarchy as something that could be dismantled, where as anthropologists would argue that it is endemic, part of our evolutionary biology. 

It took me a while to realize that feminists use the term patriarchy in a different way to anthropologists, it does not mean to them what it means to me. The issue I have is that feminist thinking does not appear to have one definition of patriarchy that it sticks to. It has become a catch all term for womens (and others) oppression and and in a way becomes meaningless. Can anyone shed some light on this issue?

10,Do I have a duty to call out misogyny among individuals in marginalized groups?,"I'm a straight white male in the U.S. and I'm wondering, should I call out misogyny among groups less privileged here? Here are the two ways I've been looking at it:

1) Yes, you should call out misogyny among black men, Muslim men, gay men, etc., because you're speaking from a shared place of privilege, your maleness, rather than from your difference, like your race or sexuality. It's insulting to members of that group to say you're not supposed to speak up because you can't fully understand their culture, as if misogyny is a valid part of any culture. If you don't speak up about misogyny because you've got more privilege than them, you're using your privilege as an excuse for inaction.

2.) No, you shouldn't call out misogyny among these groups. You should stay in your lane. There's plenty of misogyny from white straight men for you to call out without getting into problematic situations where a white man is yet again telling a black man what they need to do. Your desire to call out bad behaviors in these groups is the result of unconscious bias on your part and an attempt to deflect away from misogyny in your own group. Just as it's not your role to tell black people your opinion on whether using the N-word is helpful or harmful, it's not your role to be telling marginalized communities how to address misogyny.

Which of these ways seems more plausible to you? Is there some third option or some mixture of both I'm overlooking?

Two questions branching from that one:
1.) Does it matter whether I'm calling out misogyny I see in person or calling out misogyny in general?

For instance, it seems to me that Lil Wayne's song ""Love Me"" is shockingly misogynistic, yet it seemed to attract little controversy, while Robin Thicke's ""Blurred Lines"" (which came out around the same time) attracted a lot. Should I refrain from denouncing Lil Wayne's misogyny publicly because he's a black man and just stick to the Robin Thickes of the world? 

2.) Does it make any difference if it's a woman making misogynist (or at least problematic) comments, such as if a very conservative woman opines that feminism is a cancer on our society?

By one token,  I see how it is a safe place for girls as most other sports in that age group are co-ed. At the same time,  it feels like its perpetuating the same problems, letting girls internalize that they shouldn't be playing more masculine sports, letting those sports be ""boys clubs"".

21,"What are your thoughts on men's ""locker room talk"" and the damage or toxicity it spreads?","Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

A frequent talking point in feminist talks is ""toxic masculinity"" and ""locker room talk."" As a straight male taking an unbiased approach to studying feminism, I have some questions regarding this issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first being, what exactly does it mean when masculinity is toxic? I have an educated guess, and a quick google search gives a basic answer. Mostly this question is aimed at being able to draw a line in the sand and pinpoint the moment or qualities that makes certain behavior or speech toxic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, regarding locker room talk, I've always considered the ""locker room"" or any male space as a free or safe zone for men to talk without being judged. In my experience, the ideas expressed in the ""locker room"" don't usually carry over to the man's daily life. (A good example being Key and Peele's comedy sketch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LGEiIL1\_\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LGEiIL1__s) ) Is locker room talk really having a big effect on women and culture? Should we start to regulate what is said in these private places?

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, is it possible to set a model or definition on what masculinity should be without impeding on men's self-determination? To some, toxic masculinity is considered a tool that's used to try and control men, which is obviously an extreme argument. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, is the a female counterpoint to toxic masculinity?

39,Are gender quotas in STEM actually insulting towards women who worked their ass off to become really good at what they do?,"I've seen a few female's who got a degree in CS, worked really hard to become very good at their jobs and would have no bother competing against males without gender quotas but since there are gender quotas, they're literally flooded with emails and texts from recruiters. I'm talking x10 level of interest shown by recruiters to them over a similarly qualified male equivalent because of the potential of a big fat bonus as well as it being company policy to have a certain male:female ratio. A lot of them get pissed off/upset over this because it's not their work that's generating the level of interest, it's their gender.   


Getting really good at their job on completely equal terms to their male counterparts IS the empowering bit but then these diversity quotas are basically saying ""we need to help you compete against men"" is almost like a slap in the face to the work they have put in.

43,"I've seen plenty of discussions in the past about sexualized Halloween costumes, but what about the inverse? Kids wearing non-sexy costumes of sexualized characters.","I'll give the context that brings up this question. 

When I was a kid, my mom would sew home made Halloween costumes for me. Things like Power Rangers suits and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and stuff. Now that I have a daughter (18 month old), my mom offered to make a costume for her this year. I thought it would be cute to have her dress up like [D. Va from Overwatch](https://i.imgur.com/lGQ2l9A.png), and then I would buy a pink hoodie so as to look like the mech and she could ride around on my shoulders. For reference, this is what the costume looks like (still in its unfinished state): [\[Costume\]](https://imgur.com/a/HeJu7sb) [\[Test fitting\]](https://imgur.com/a/GCzvJIo).

My wife brought up that she was mildly uncomfortable with the idea of dressing her up as a character that is pretty sexualized\^1. My view is that while yes, D.Va is pretty sexualized. However, I don't think that that taints every depiction of the character (especially given that the Overwatch community routinely makes fanart of her that [completely](https://i.imgur.com/ROce2lC.jpg) [downplays](https://i.imgur.com/2sjErjS.jpg) [her](https://i.imgur.com/0rdt7gZ.jpg) [sexiness](https://i.imgur.com/LDaRvQP.png), which seems to be rare for female game characters), or that my toddler is being sexualized by association. Without knowing the connection, the costume itself is  little more than a children's onesie. Is my thinking off base here? Would you be uncomfortable with a toddler who is a year an a half old dressing up as D. Va?

\^1: This was after the costume was already made. I didn't go ahead and have my mom make the costume in spite of my wife's objections. She's probably going to go trick or treating in a different costume, but mostly because she's worried no one will get the costume.

44,"How to respond to ""why should I bet my career on her""?","TLDR: How to respond to ""I don't want to bet my career on her""? For dealing with proponents of strict pence rule.

Now being a minority race at 6 foot tall weighing 85 kgs with a beard... I get where my friend is coming from. I can almost predict with 100% certainty what would happen if any woman points at me with a false allegation. I'd be dragged down to the precinct and literally everyone would write me off as ""he did it"" but she couldn't prove it situation.... My only response to him was why would she do that? To which he responded with some links to that lady accusing that boy and some other examples of ladies accusing men out of spite to which my only response was those are very rare...

Now if I'm 100% honest, that experience has left me with that image of me being dragged down to the precinct for something I didn't do. I know its stupid okay. I get it. Then I look at my life and realise that I'm actually living it avoiding any kind of situation where I'd be implicated and that my friend was somewhat right about guys needing to protect themselves to an extent and that I'm being a hypocrite. Like I follow a strict open door policy and minimise non-work related social interactions with women from work unless its in a public setting like an office party or dinner etc. 

Then I see what's happening in Korea with segregation, my workplace and what all my friends are discussing and it makes me feel like we are moving further and further away from equality and more and more towards some kind of segregated ""zoo"" type of life where we are all looking at each other through ""glass enclosures"".

I actually discussed this with a female feminist friend of mine that I trust very much and she was like ""dude wtf that's stupid"". I've known you my whole life and you are just being paranoid. You aren't going to get accused falsely"". Just makes me feel like all of us are living totally different lives and we all have our sights set on destroying each other with some 0 sum game.

46,"Without meaning to sound like an apologist, is it okay to say not all victims of sexual abuse and not all of the men convicted are equal?","I am generally a liberal, but try to always be moderate. I am also a man and I accept there are genuine human experiences I simply don't go through because of this. They are things that women are so conscious of to the point a lot of it is a given. That is why when something I know nothing about confuses me, I try to remove myself from my skin and listen to be able to consider the perspective at all.



Let me start by saying all accusations should be treated seriously and their severity granted benefit of the doubt. False accusations are negligibly low compared to true accusations, and I am certain that the number of men who have gotten away with heinous shit outweigh those rightfully convicted and FAR outweigh those falsely convicted. This is why all reports must be dealt with urgently and in a manner that is consistent for all accusations and encourages victims to speak out.



That being said, all accusations are not equal. While assault is assault and there is no excusing an act, just like murder, there are cases that display varying degrees of the accused's sexual infringement and impropriety, is there not? The best way I can think to show this contrast is Harvey Weinstein (used his career to get women in bed, was recorded assaulting a maid, dozens of accusers) vs Louis C.K. (admitted masturbating over the phone and in front of multiple women). The specificity of the cases aside, these are two different crimes.  Undoubtedly, they belong under the same umbrella, but they give different two different depictions of misconduct. Yet the men are condemned the same way. 



What I see on TV is just how much the public eye and media nfluences the perspectives regarding such occurrences. It tends to really set the tone for how everyone feels and talks about the victims and the accused. It's commonly said that women see men walk away unharmed after facing allegations and must feel discouraged. This is unfortunately true.


Others say men see women ruin someone's livelihood over accusations and fear for themselves. I think this (incorrect and misguided) narrative has to do with the fact that public outrage at sexual misconduct is the same regardless of its degree. Is it wrong to think that some assaults may actually be a mistake? A grave and awful one worthy of retribution, but a mistake nonetheless?
If people stick to facts and testimony, and allow the accused's reaction to speak for the allegations, the really horrible people and the less (intentionally) mysoginistic ones will show themselves, wouldn't they? 



I would never ask these questions to anyone for fear of being chastised or labelled in some way so I will just ask here if any female can help:

- How might a victim who has been subject to physical and violent sexual abuse feel sharing the same #MeToo platform with a woman who speaks out about their trauma of being masturbated to? 

- Is there a debate to be had about these degrees?

- Is there even a debate to be had about the moral equivalency of different cases of sexual misconduct? 



- I can be objectively CERTAIN I have never raped anyone, but I can't be certain I haven't ""misconducted"" in the past. I know they say if you did nothing wrong then you have nothing to fear, but if the terms used to describe all instances of sexual impropriety are the same, there would be nothing separating someone who made a terrible mistake from someone who did committed the act willfully and out of real misogyny.

47,"Liberal feminists who support trans rights, how did you come to support trans rights and why do you believe in the ideology of some trans people?","I'm looking for answers from a certain perspective so I'd prefer it if gender critical feminists and trans feminists don't answer. Also if you don't know much about trans people, and are unsure, please don't answer either. 

Personally, I am trans (mtf) and I don't call myself a woman. I haven't been socialized as a woman, I haven't dealt with issues women have to deal with, and although the patriarchy hasn't been kind to me, there are moments where I have benefited from it. I live my life as a shut-in, I don't interact with people at all and I've tried to fix my gender dysphoria in many ways before transitioning as a last ditch attempt to be happy. I agree with many feminist issues, but as a man, I don't think I can call myself a feminist. 

Anyways, I believe that most trans individuals have problems including autogynephilia, excessive fetishization, misogyny, etc. I won't pretend I'm above it all, because I'm not. Although I will say that I'm a HSTS (Being attracted to men), but of course that doesn't excuse my misogyny. I am disgusted by the actions of the trans community, I am disgusted by what it's become, I am disgusted by the trans rights movement. I may be gender dysphoric but I don't want to associate myself with those people. And my question is why do you? I know that concept of intersectionality pops up a lot, but is that enough to ignore the bad that trans people do? 

If I were a natal woman, I would have rejected the claims of trans activists long ago because I believe that they're wrong. What makes you willing to accept them? Do you have trans people in your life who don't act like the stereotype of what our community is? Or do you just view them as angels because the media pushes the view that all trans people should be accepted? I want to know what makes you support trans people because as a trans person, I absolutely don't. I think transphobia is absolutely justified in our society among women.

59,"How can I make a change in society, farther than just supporting worthy causes?","The issues I want to bring up here don't just apply to feminism; I mean to refer to more broad political views as well, like trans rights, xenophobia and others, but this is the best place I could think of to post it, since I feel like most of you might feel the same way (and a good proportion of you a *very* intelligent).

So, my issue is, I feel like I'm not making enough of a difference.

I mean, I do what I can as an average 18 year old - I will challenge bigoted opinions when I encounter them, I learn as much as I can on these issues from online sources, books and articles, and I have tried to get my school talking more about these topics by starting discussion groups, holding talks and events, and putting up posters, as well as just setting a good example at school in my year and the yeargroups below - but I don't feel like I'm making genuine societal change. I often feel like I'm either preaching to the choir, or that people just haven't taken on anything that I've said at all.

It seems increasingly that there's this unmendable rift in society between one side and the other, and it's just getting bigger as time progresses. I'm saying this as a British person, but the news that I see almost every day coming from America makes me genuinely worried and afraid of the people making the decisions (not that Britain doesn't have its own issues in this regard, but it seems especially pronounced in the U.S. at the moment). Not just for the fact that I am a trans girl, but for the fact that I have generally very left-wing views, and seeing the world moving away from that towards hate and bigotry makes me feel like there's no hope.

But it also makes me want to do something about it. I want to be able to change the way that people think about these issues, and maybe get them to see the more sympathetic viewpoint. I'm very much a ""kill 'em with kindess"" kind of person, and I don't think that public debate or argument is conducive to change, in fact it just deepens the divide. I am happy to explain things in earnest to people who don't understand the issues properly.

67,I feel like it is impossible to argue with a feminist.,"Please don't misinterpret what I'm saying, with argue I mean discuss in a manner which will result in both parties learning something new. By discussing things with others both online and offline I have radically changed my views, I used to be an ancap and now I am a socialist/syndicalist for example. I am not a closed minded person and as an egalitarian and someone who believes in a meritocracy I believe women are worth just as much as men.  


That being said, I find it absolutely impossible to discuss anything with feminists. When I try to question feminists about their views or present a fact that goes against their narrative they will accuse me of toxic masculinity, mansplaining or of having a ""fragile male ego"". When you are confronted with a fact you will often just come with up with some alternative explanation without any scientific backing whatsoever. (e.g. If you say women make less because they choose different jobs in a certain country, many feminists will claim they only choose a different job because of societal pressures. They have absolutely no empirical data that proves this is the case but if fits their agenda so they just roll with it.).  


Having said this, it is not my intention to ""debunk feminism"" or insult you with this post. I simply want to ask WHY do you keep confusing everyone with academic jargon that will just get misinterpreted instead of just giving a straightforward answer? And do you really think you are going to convince anyone by acting so pedantic and dismissive of everyone? There is a reason most women in the UK no longer even identify as feminists, if you really care about your cause shouldn't you change your attitude?

If you’re not going to be responsible and take responsibility of a result that happened from your actions, maybe you shouldn’t be having sex at all? This also leads me into saying that what if the father wants to keep the baby and you don’t?

103,Radiolab - In the No,"Hi everybody. I hope that many of you are familiar with the Radiolab podcast. They just released part 3 of a 3 part series that deals with communication and consent around sex, and ways in which that can break down.

I was curious if any of you had listened to it and if so, what your thoughts on it were. 


Below is the introduction that Radiolab wrote about the episode on their podcast.
&gt;In 2017, radio-maker Kaitlin Prest released a mini-series called ""No"" about her personal struggle to understand and communicate about sexual consent. That show, which dives into the experience, moment by moment, of navigating sexual intimacy, struck a chord with many of us. It's gorgeous, deeply personal, and incredibly thoughtful. And it seemed to presage a much larger conversation that is happening all around us in this moment. And so we decided to embark, with Kaitlin, on our own exploration of this topic. Over the next three episodes, we'll wander into rooms full of college students, hear from academics and activists, and sit in on classes about BDSM. But to start things off, we are going to share with you the story that started it all. Today, meet Kaitlin (if you haven't already).

119,Confused about rape statistics (cross posted on r/Feminism but the post never appeared...)," 

Hi r/AskFeminists. I recently came across two reports (links &amp; tl;dr at bottom) that appear to show that nearly as many men as women are raped on an annual basis (if made to penetrate is considered rape), and that the ratio of male rapists to female rapists is somewhere around 2:1 (less clear because repeat offenders can't be determined). It is my understanding that the typically quoted statistics is that 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men are raped, but this completely goes against the two studies I found. I have also found informational pages that contradict themselves: [https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics?fbclid=IwAR39cak1Od8gwZH7eCIY-MKCjBBumtq7TrnEEENGOIE\_vSWdAj\_fj1n\_zoo](https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics?fbclid=IwAR39cak1Od8gwZH7eCIY-MKCjBBumtq7TrnEEENGOIE_vSWdAj_fj1n_zoo) in which both the 1 in 5/1 in 71 figure is stated, and a figure that 20-25% of college women and 15% of college men are raped. If 15% of college men are raped, more than 1 in 71 men are raped overall. I don't want any replies saying the studies are biased or by the evil patriarchal media, if you see any legitimate flaws then feel free to point them out. Additionally if you find any studies that are larger in scope or more detailed in their data acquisition, feel free to comment them. I personally think the National Crime Victimization Survey is to blame for under-reported female on male rape in many cited statistics. The survey is in person, and directly asks people if they've been raped. I think many men think rape means forced penetration, not forced or coerced sex, thus they say they haven't been raped even if they have.

Finally note that I am absolutely still a feminist, regardless of what is true about rape statistics and how often men vs women are the perpetrators. Patriarchal oppression likely plays a large part in the prevalence of rape of all kinds. However feminism may need to ditch the attitude that men are the only problem when it comes to rape, if these surveys are accurate. Also this only applies to the US of course. From what I've seen, other countries (India for example) have huge problems with women being raped by men, and less so the other way around.

Study/article 1 (Shows near identical sexual victimization between women and men for the non-incarcerated population):

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/?fbclid=IwAR2SwkEapxF0Ujsw2G-Cj7cHxt4aRBHiiIEfZcy9tDJ0IUH1xRipsL0DsAw](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/?fbclid=IwAR2SwkEapxF0Ujsw2G-Cj7cHxt4aRBHiiIEfZcy9tDJ0IUH1xRipsL0DsAw)

Also this survey asks people only about the last 12 months so it's not saying only \~1% of women/men are raped, just that many in the last year.

Study/article 2 (Shows women are the perpetrators of rape more often than previously thought):

[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/?fbclid=IwAR1GvYqrK-o-mjD\_IgEfjb6HQEyWbnf6vZ4CJqxRtMEXSWVmC6k\_APxglMc](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/?fbclid=IwAR1GvYqrK-o-mjD_IgEfjb6HQEyWbnf6vZ4CJqxRtMEXSWVmC6k_APxglMc)

**Tl;Dr**: I came across two studies that may show that men are raped nearly as often as women, and that women perpetrate rape more often than (I?) previously thought. Is this true?

125,What laws need to be changed to help men who were falsely accused of rape and sexual assault?,"Rape and sexual assault are both very serious issues. But a other equally concerning issue is the effect of false accusations of rape and sexual assault. There are many examples such as Emmett Till, the Duke Lacrosse situation, etc, in which the male Victims were disenfranchised and punished by law and Society without any compensation. The Constitutional""Innocent until proven guilty"" seem like one of the few instances where it's acceptable to ignore, is during a rape accusations or sexual assault accusation.         
        
[In some countries like Spain](http://kukuruyo.com/2016/02/17/spain-gender-laws-a-country-against-men/)
 it's far worst in this regard since the laws are exploitable.        
         
         
I personally am a man that go by the original meaning of the term ""Feminist"" meaning equality of the genders, not the new aged meaning of the term. And I believe false rape and false sexual assault accusation and the treatment of the male Victims in these situations is unfair and unequal. Honestly at this point I don't even see people taking the rape and sexual assault of men as being nothing but a joke and not taken as equally seriously as women that make accusations. For example a man accused Halle Berry of sexually assaulting him, and she made a very disrespectful remark towards the male accusers yet no repercussion was made on her part. That's not equality if we going to be honest here.

[Clashes Blocking Women From Temple in India Bring Over 2,000 Arrests](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/world/asia/india-hindu-temple-arrests.html)

Oct. 26, 2018

NEW DELHI — As India grapples with questions of how much government institutions should be involved in religious affairs, a violent war of wills playing out over women’s access to one of Hinduism’s most important temples has led to the arrest of more than 2,000 people this past week, the police said on Friday.

After India’s Supreme Court struck down a 1991 ban that forbade women of childbearing age to pray at the Sabarimala Temple, a centuries-old hillside shrine in the southern state of Kerala, it did not take long for protesters to set vehicles on fire, pummel the police and attack women who tried to hike up a three-mile trail to reach the temple.

Thousands of furious devotees — many of them women — have vowed to resist the court’s verdict, saying it would chip away at years of tradition.

In recent days, leaders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and another powerful rival party, the Indian National Congress, which has traditionally extended rights to minorities, have sided with proponents of the ban.

Since the 2014 national election of Mr. Modi, whose party has ties to Hindu nationalist groups, a burst of religious conservatism has swept through many parts of India.

When the Sabarimala Temple opened last week for the first time since the court’s ruling, hundreds of baton-wielding police officers braced for a face-off near the shrine, vowing that they would uphold the law and protect any woman who wished to visit the temple.

Before the temple closed on Monday evening for two weeks, at least 12 women had attempted the journey. All were harassed. None of them made it. One woman was so shaken that she fainted.


Last Thursday, when a female journalist for The New York Times started hiking toward the temple, she was met with a screaming mob of hundreds of people, chased down the hill and hit with a rock on the shoulder. She was not seriously injured.

By Friday, Krishna Kumar, a senior police official in Kerala, said 2,061 people had been arrested for preventing officials from enforcing the court’s verdict and for “creating trouble intentionally.”

Mr. Krishna said he was worried about the temple’s November reopening, which marks the start of peak season. In the coming weeks, the pilgrimage to the Sabarimala Temple draws millions of devotees, and is often compared locally to the Hajj to Mecca.

This week, officials in Kerala released photographs of more than 200 people suspected of violently blocking women from reaching the temple. Some were members of far-right Hindu sects.

Next month, 5,000 additional police officers will be deployed in the area. “It’s going to be a huge task,” he said.

In India, a multiethnic country of 1.3 billion people, court mandates are often loosely enforced, especially in rural areas. But the police in Kerala, a highly literate state run by a coalition of communist parties, have encouraged women to visit the Sabarimala Temple, despite the security risks.

But advocates of the ban say that women of childbearing age, defined by temple caretakers as those between 10 and 50 years old, should not be allowed to visit because the shrine’s deity, Lord Ayyappa, is celibate. Some Hindus consider menstruating women to be impure.

The Supreme Court announced on Tuesday that it would hear 19 review petitions next month challenging the ruling, though lawyers said it was unlikely that the decision would be overturned.



So these men are acting shamefully, without question, I don't think anyone would sympathize with throwing rocks at journalists. But did India's Supreme Court make the right decision to open the temple to women in the first place? Why or why not? What's the basis of that decision?

My first reaction is just that these men need to be put in their place and knocked down a peg or two. They need to accept women's equality and worth. For women to visit the temple will at least be a public acknowledgement of sex/gender equality, and in that it is good.

But I also think sometimes it's okay for religious temples to regard traditions and ways that might seem confusing or counterintuitive or just wrong to me, and I'm not sure whether  religious spaces for exclusively men should ideally be included in that or not. I understand there is a need for women's spiritual spaces, but that need exists in part because of living in a culture dominated by men. So, Are safe spaces for men ever acceptable, and if so why not the Sabarimala shrine?

135,Is sexualizing people wrong?,"
Okay so I was dating this girl for about seven months, whose since left me. Recently I heard from a mutuel friend that the reason she left me was because I never tried to have sex with her and she didn't feel desired.

Now I'm not stupid I knew she wanted to have sex and there were at least a couple of occasions where one would expect something to happen, like during a kissing session, but when it came up I just got really uncomfortable and chickened out. I'm sure she was really disappointed in wasting her time with me, but that's beside the point.

My problem is that even making physical compliments feel wrong. For instance it was only two months into our relationship, I remember I was washing the dishes when she slapped my butt and said it looked nice and asked me what I thought of her butt. I told her it was nice, but the rest of the day I felt off that I had said it, because I've always strived to be nice to her and it felt like I was reducing her to an object just by saying those words. Like yeah your personality is great and all, but your ass is nize!

It's not like I didn't find her attractive, that's kind of the point I found her too attractive. Like tmi, but just thinking about her got me excited. And it wasn't her intelligence or her ability to play the trumpet or any of those things, it was her butt or breasts, or her touching me that did it. Which is what depresses me the most, it's like I like her only because I'm attracted to her body. I try to prove to myself that it's okay to like her body, as much as you like her as a person (and isn't her body part of her person as well?), I've never convinced myself. It always comes back to me thinking that the moment I try to do something sexual with her, I'm affronting her and treating her less than the person I know her to be.

My friend on the other hand told me that he compliments his girlfriend all the time, he'll tell her how hot she is, and even compliment specific parts of her body. He tells me that makes her feel wanted, to me it seems wrong to say ""Wow your ass is so hot!"" It's like you're reducing her to only her body part and seems disrespectful.
It might not be true that saying her body is attractive makes you sexist, but it seems like it communicates an underlying message that if you weren't hot or sexy then I wouldn't really be with you.

The thing is now that I know this has ruined at least one relationship (I don't know about the others), I'd like to find someway to change it.

I also want to be clear that I do understand that some trans women identify as male and others as female and I respect that, but that doesn't mean they actually belong to the sex category they identify as belonging to. Does it? Point being we can disagree without being disrespectful, so let's.

Gender is easy peasy cuz we just take peoples word for what they ID as. But what makes a person male or female, and can that change, or be misidentified in dyadic (non intersex) people? Am I male or female? IDK, and I admit it's a bit befuddling.

143,Question for male Feminists/Allies about their personal awakenings.,"I say that this question is for male feminists but I’ll welcome any perspective! But for those who have experienced a feminist awakening (that is, have gone from a position of not identifying with feminism or opposing feminism, to identifying with and supporting feminism), have you ever experienced anxiety or distress over the knowledge that you’ve failed to live up to feminist values? That is to say, following the consumption of feminist literature and perspectives which would allow you to identify your own toxic or harmful behaviors or views, how were you able to cope with the realization that you had these negative aspects of your personality.

Hyper-specific question, I know.

I'm not really a feminist, so I used to eat up the Anti-SJW stuff on Youtube. The thing is, things like ShoeOnHead or ArmoredSkeptic lead into more radical views and towards communities that actually hate women and lack empathy towards minorities. This idea of an ""Anti-SJW problem"" only seems to finally be gaining traction on Youtube in recent months, and people are looking towards channels like ContraPoints. There's a **high demand with barely any supply** for channels that can point out common sense being militantly used as a way to generalize the left by pointing to far-left extremist ""SJWs"", who at least have good intentions most of the time.

146,How do you convince a man that sexual assault is a bigger deal than what some of them make it out to be?,"First of all, I'd like to say that unless someone is truly close-minded, people do change their opinions and behaviors even from being borderline criminal. Now, regarding the question. I'm a guy and it just dawned upon me why so many guys either don't care about female sexual assault or tell women they're overreacting: It's just a form of projection. I've never felt threatened if I've been flirted on, even aggressively. I've had older women feel up my ass, but my thought isn't even ""ew"" when it happens, it's more pity that she even feels the need to do that to someone, especially since I'm not even that handsome of a target. I guess it sounds messed up, but every time I've been sexually assaulted I've either gotten turned on, flattered by her aggressive attempts, or felt pity and at most annoyance. Not really the kind of stuff that girls face. 

Anyways, I've been thinking that not even Feminists bring this up when talking to guys about these things, for some reason. I think you should explore it next time a guy on the internet says ""man up"" in response to light ""me too"" sort of stuff (which often gets mocked).

Women absolutely should feel comfortable to wear whatever they want to wear; but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t creeps out there that they need to protect themselves from. If we lived in a perfect world that wouldn’t be a problem; but we don’t so it is.

Text 

&gt;So I've recently been hanging out with a group of gay guys I met that is the general ""crew"" of a coworker (coworker is gay, as am I, and introduced me to his friends, now we all chill). Anyway, one of the guys in the group is super transphobic and seems even hostile about his beliefs. When we met, I could tell immediately that he found me attractive and he's very flirty. Last time the crew went out drinking I didn't join because I had a bunch of work shit to catch up on, but I was home sober and he sent me dick pics and some insinuating texts.

I happen to be transgender (FtM) and my coworker doesn't know, and the entire crew has no idea. I'm not attracted to this guy AT ALL but I couldn't stop myself from being handsy and offering him a blowjob just because I found it satisfying that he has ""no respect for or attraction to trans people"". He said he'd never mess around with a ""tranny"". Well I sucked him off and he bricked down my throat. I can't decide whether I want to admit that I'm transgender and I probably wont. But feels good to confess. I ""swallowed"" his pride LMAO.

173,My reaction to some instances of modern feminism has led me to denying my male privilege and it’s making me feel awful.,"I don’t even know where to start with this. 

I think of myself as a feminist, and quite a dedicated one. I totally acknowledge that as a man, who was born male, I have received privileges in my life that I wouldn’t have, if I was a woman. I always try my best to be a good ally, which is why the way I’ve been feeling lately has me feeling so guilty and pretty disappointed in myself. 

It’s really come about from three things, all in the past week: 

1. An anecdote I saw online where a public speaker asks the audience for a list of things they have to do on a night out in order to stay safe. The women come up with lengthy list, while the men just say they don’t really think about it.

2. A conversation with some friends about “what’s the worst date you’ve ever been on?” which was shut down by a female friend who argued that as men we had no idea how bad a date could get, and we were all speaking from a position of privilege.

3. This idiom I saw on Reddit, paraphrased from The Handmaid’s Tale but general consensus was that it applies in our real world: “Men worry that women will laugh at them; women worry that men will kill them.” 

All three things have been going around in my head for a few days now, and I’m ashamed to say that now, after dwelling on them for all that time, I don’t agree with any of them. I think they’re judgmental, presumptuous, and ignorant. And it’s making me actually want to deny the level of privilege I’ve had. 

It’s the first time I’ve ever felt myself reacting this way. The worst part is, I hate seeing men react like this. So I feel really disappointed in myself for doing so. 

A little background, I guess. 

From the ages of 16-21, I was in an abusive relationship with a woman. We lived together, and she would physically and emotionally abuse me, on a daily basis. Usually I didn’t feel like I could leave her. If I did try to end the relationship, she’d threaten to kill herself, and once she had me back, she’d promise that things would be different, but they never were. I never knew how to react to the abuse, so I would let it happen. She would tell me, if I ever tried to fight back, she’d make sure that it left visible injuries so she could go to the police and accuse me of assaulting her, because “the police always believe the woman”. On two separate occasions, she tried to murder me. Once with a knife, once with a broken glass. The relationship only ended because she cheated on me and became pregnant, so left to be with the other guy. 

When I was 23, I went on a date with a man, which ended in us going back to his flat. He was drunk, and tried to force me to have sex with him. He physically restrained me and refused to let me leave. He told me that I’d be giving him signals all night. He kept telling me to calm down and relax, and just let it happen. It was terrifying. He texted me the next day as if nothing had happened. I avoided him after that. 

Now, here’s where my feelings get a bit complicated. I hope I can convey them in a way that makes sense. 

There are many, many women who have had experiences similar to mine, and it’s awful. It’s definitely a problem that affects women more commonly than men. For every women who’s had to deal with instances of assault, abuse or harassment, I want to support them, and I want them to know that the way they feel is valid, and their emotions are important. 

But what’s difficult to me is that in the three occurrences I listed above, I feel like my own experiences and feelings are being trivialised and negated. By being told that I don’t have to worry about keeping myself safe, and that I don’t know what a bad date looks like, and the worst fear I could possibly have is that a woman might laugh at me, because there’s no risk to my safety. And that’s all because of my privilege. 

I guess it’s because in all of those instances, the bit of the statement which negates my feelings isn’t even necessary. Maybe the best way to look at it is via that idiom I mentioned earlier. 

“Women worry that men will kill them.”  

My response to that would be: “That’s awful. It’s not right that a woman should have to feel that way.” 

But instead we get: 

“Men worry that women will laugh at them; women worry that men will kill them.”

I feel horrible about all the things I’ve had to go through, but I have enough empathy in me to realise that other people, the majority of them women, have been through similar and much worse. So why should that statement even be qualified by the first half? Why do my experiences have to be negated and trivialised, before another person’s feelings are regarded? Why would people just assume that I never have to worry about staying safe on a date? Why would someone tell me that just because I’m a man, I don’t know what a bad date looks like? 

Part of me feels like I’m not entitled to those feelings of having suffered abuse. I feel like all these other people are telling me that my feelings don’t matter, and a part of me believes it. That just makes me feel more ashamed. 

I hate that I feel like this. It makes me feel guilty and ashamed and like I just want to go back and erase all of the experiences I’ve had that have made me feel this way.

I’m seriously in tears typing this. And maybe that makes it worse, the feeling that if I ever actually try to talk to someone about this, and express why it upsets me so much, I’ll just get shot down. 

Some of my friends quite enjoy the phrase “White male tears lol” whenever it comes to a man complaining about stupid things like “why isn’t there an international *men’s* day?!”. I guess I’m just scared that I’ll pour out my heart to someone and just get told that. “White male tears lol”. 

Yeah, I’ve posted this from a throwaway account. And I’m sorry about that. I’m not looking for validation or sympathy. I just wanted to express this to someone, and maybe get some input. I’m sorry if this whole post is a bit all over the place. I’ll be honest, I don’t even know what I’m hoping for from this.

To keep this brief, I have to DIY my own education because I can't afford to go to school, but I have problems with ADHD that prevent me from concentrating on text for very long. Videos (and to a smaller extent podcasts, though they tend to be a last resort) circumvent this, and I usually retain more as I rewatch the same stuff often.

I know generally about feminism from various sources and studies, but I want to actually go back and cover the foundation. If you know anything that starts off very simple before working outward, that'd be perfect. On a similar note, if there's any way you could avoid series by self-proclaimed radical feminists, that'd be very helpful.

193,"Do you have to ""do something"" or be active to be an feminist?","Some comments that inspired this question:
[diskussion about sexism]
commenter A: ""People who say they're equalists never have an answer to ""Oh OK. What do you do about that?"" Feminists tend to have marches, campaigns, support political candidates, donate to feminist causes, volunteer for feminist groups, etc. ""Equalists"" or ""Egalitarian"" are just people who don't want to say ""Feminist"" because we're such terrible boogeymen!!""
Commenter B:""I mean, I identify as feminist, but I don't do anything about it either.""

So what do you think? Do you have to do something to be considered a feminist? Or is it enough that you identify as one, and don't do something blatantly anti-feminist? 

I do identify as a feminist, as in I believe women should have same worth and same rights as men. But i don't go to marches, I donate to charity (anti-fgm work) but I don't do it because of my feminism, I don't volunteer for feminist groups. I don't vote based on my feminism (ie. they don't have to identify or market themselves as feminists), but I would not vote on a overtly sexist person and often I vote on a woman. 

In my day to day life I let a lot of the sexism that we are surrounded by be, since often I am just focused on my life. But through ""passive"" methods I am a feminist: I use inclusive language, I try to encourage people to do what they want regardless of gender,  I try to not be afraid to break gender stereotypes or expectations myself. I like to discuss sexism and gender, and when such a discussion is relevant I am not afraid to bring forth examples of studies that show how ingrained sexism is in our society.

They say ""everyone should be a feminist"" but does that mean supporting womens rights, or fighting for them?

194,Why should people make ‘we care about men too’ a vocal point of their feminism?,"I don’t understand why some antimisogynists explicitly appeal to the self‐interest of the privileged. I haven’t seen any other movement do this. As far as I know, Civil Rights activists and BLM haven’t been advertising to everybody how much they care about whites. Gay rights organizations haven’t been busy discussing the mutual benefits that gay rights could offer. Disability organizations don’t do this, *&amp;c.* Why should antimisogyny be any different? Maybe I’m only not helping when I add this (I’m a man, I think), but you shouldn’t ***have*** to list examples of male‐friendly action and otherwise assure everybody that you care about blokes too. Focussing on women’s issues should be perfectly adequate! There’s nothing wrong with it! (And yes, water is wet also!)

Lastly, multiple times I’ve seen antifems read or hear about male‐friendly content only to finish angrier than ever. [Like here](https://i.reddit.com/comments/8kri5k) for example. I suppose that a ‘men’s rights’ community is low‐hanging fruit as their hostile reaction is to be expected, but I can’t think of any other examples of nonfeminists reacting (positively) to such content, so I get the feeling that it’s a waste of time anyway.

200,False Accusations,"Hey all. I have a story and some questions about false accusations of sexual assault. A lot of men speak as though false accusations are as commonplace and problematic as assaults themselves. I have always dismissed this as a misogynistic trope which portrays women as either crazy or kniving, and been quick to beleive any woman who has come to me with a story about assault. I have ended a couple of friendships because I heard from others that they committed rape.


I am now unsure if I have had the right attitude. Earlier today I was called into the dean of students office at my school and informed that a female student had issued a no contact order against me for ""non-consensual kissing and touching"" at a party during May of last year.


I had met this woman at the party in question. She was about three years older than I, so probably about 21. I am a regular at the venue, and I hadn't seen her there before, so I got her a drink and struck up a conversation about our majors. I remember that she had been doing some really interesting research, I think it was about historical poverty tourism.


We sat at the couch down there talking for a while, maybe half an hour, and eventually everyone else had cleared out of that room. I beleive I am pretty good at reading body language and nonverbal cues, and I got the sense she was interested in me (arm touching, lots of eye contact, continuously moving closer to me on the couch, etc). I decided to make the first move by placing my hand on the side of her cheek, making eye contact for a moment incase I had read the situation incorrectly, and then leaning in for a kiss. She kissed me back for a moment but, when I learned in more she pulled away. I pulled back and she said that we needed to talk about something. She explained that she had a girlfriend, but that it was a semi-open relationship  in that they where okay with kissing but not sleeping with other people. She wanted to know if I was comfortable with that, which I was, and then after making explicit, verbal, and affirmative consent we went back at it for the rest of the evening. Later that night she told me that she and her girlfriend share stories about the people they do this with, and that it is ""very hot for us"". Internally I thought this was pretty corny, but I tried to keep a straight face. She also told me that she doesn't normally do anything with guys after being sexually assaulted by a man earlier in her life.


She left the party a little while later with the friend she came with. I didn't get her phone number, and I didn't remember her name in the morning so I haven't seen her since. You can imagine my surprise when I am informed 6 months later that she has taken out a no-contact order. I feel quite hurt, betrayed, confused, and worried that my peers are going to hear about it. Despite our age difference and lack of social connections, it is a very small school and rumors travel quickly.


If this sort of thing is actually as common as I've been told by the men around me growing up, then it would have pretty massive implications about how I see gender relations, current events (#metoo), and my own relationships. I understand that in some circumstances accusations of rape and assault have been one of the few ways women can get men to take them seriously, so it makes sense that it might be an advantageous strategy from an evolutionary perspective, but it still feels like a huge violation of trust.


I don't really remember how much we had to drink that night, so it is possible that I blacked out and did something horrible then, but I really doubt it since I only remember having two or three. I'm pretty sure she only had the drink I gave her, and the one she already had, but maybe she had actually had more before I showed up and wasn't in a state to give consent? Again, I highly doubt that this is the case as I think I would have been able to tell.


So assuming it wasn't the alcohol, the only options that this leaves me with are that one of us is delusional, that for whatever reason she decided to make a false accusation, or that she was referencing the first kiss, for which I relied on nonverbal cues rather than affirmative verbal consent. This last option seems rather silly, but I have met people that insist on the notion that nonverbal consent doesn't exist, so maybe that is her perspective. If it is though, why wouldn't she mention that right after I made the first move? What motivation could someone have for making a false accusation like this, especially a no-contact order which won't have any legal ramifications?

Before the rise of this horrific cultural climate, I used to believe that most men were good.  Now I can’t unsee how ubiquitous misogyny is.  The fact that it is borderline institutionalized at this point is making me  ill.  I just want to go somewhere where I can feel comfortable in my own skin.

r/SJWstories
I was an SJW until I was told I was gatekeeping rape after speaking about my experience by other SJWs. [rant]

&gt;u/bettsbrook
&gt;I used to be a SJW. I would constantly debate people on Facebook when their opinions didn’t match my own- I was at uni and was surrounded by people that thought the same way- we weren’t taught independent thought- can’t believe I got in all that debt and wasn’t taught how to think creatively.

&gt;But slowly my eyes were being opened. I kept seeing tops in popular stores ‘women are the future’ and was thinking to myself: imagine if a man wore a top that said ‘men are the future’ and also it bothered me that this was selling in popular stores- it seemed attention seeking and I didn’t think a political agenda should be a fashion statement.

&gt;So a few months ago I made a comment about the MeToo movement on a subreddit that kind of blew up. I spoke about how I didn’t see the MeToo movement as particularly helpful and even though I’d had my own experience with rape, I felt uncomfortable with the movement. I felt uncomfortable that people were putting MeToo when they had been wolf whistled but others were putting MeToo when they had been viciously sexually assaulted. I just didn’t understand how you could put the two in the same category and whilst I understood that all harassment was a problem and the movement was supposed to showcase all the harassment women went through on a daily basis it didn’t feel right. You’re not getting an accurate representation. I knew other people who had been raped and they too felt uncomfortable so they didn’t do a MeToo status- it lead me to think that the majority of people who put MeToo were doing it for the sake of attention and wanted to be seen as a victim. I didn’t want to do that and I know others didn’t want to either.

&gt;Anyway after I made the comment I got a tonne of comments from SJWs. I was told I was gatekeeping rape- didn’t realise ensuring rape wasn’t minimised to the same level as wold whistling was that much of an issue... like seriously I had people telling me that I couldn’t say that rape was worse than wolf whistling because of peoples feelings. Fuck your feelings, I’m telling you that someone whistling to someone across the street could never compare to someone forcing themselves inside of you. At the time however, I didn’t argue back and just shrivelled up and apologised, after I kept getting horrible private messages, I ended up deleting my account.

&gt;I had feminists tell me that I was the problem with society and had a few people tell me that I probably deserved to be raped. I was told to shut up and my opinion was playing into the agenda of those who wanted to cause harm to women. Im sick of being told we live in a rape culture by SJWs- as someone who has been raped I can confirm that we fucking don’t!

&gt;It just makes me laugh that SJWs think they’re going to change someone’s opinion when their language is so violent and not backed by facts- they were literally verbally attacking my opinion on something I know a lot about because I’ve experienced it- but then I’ve seen them attack males for having an opinion about MeToo because they couldn’t possibly know what it’s like “you’re a cis white male and therefore your opinion doesn’t matter.” Fuck off.

&gt;All of my friends are feminists and I love them dearly but whenever someone starts talking about the gender pay gap, I’m struggling to keep my eyes from rolling out of my skull. I’m not a very articulate person whereas all of my friends are and I feel like I can’t debate them, so I just keep listening to their brainwashed leftist rhetoric without joining in.

&gt;Man. Those guys are like cognitive rapists...


&gt;megabits
&gt;It sounds like you could use some new friends, ones that aren't in the cult.


&gt;bettsbrook 
&gt;I think they’re just uneducated like I was. I don’t want to force my views on them but I drop subtle things like ‘have you watched any Ben Shapiro videos?’ Without attaching an opinion that shows my bias il back it up with ‘they’re quite entertaining’ and then hope they’ll watch at some point and just redpill themselves. Especially as most people are left wing when they’re young and get more conservative as they grow up- I’m only 23 and most of my friends are. They are lovely people and tend to be on the more tolerant side of feminism, just ill informed ☺️


&gt;FurherWeeaboo 
&gt;I guess my worry is them sinking deeper into that void. My friend was like this until she turned into this monster i dont know. (I knew this girl for close to 10 years.)


bettsbrook 
&gt;I think that’s a decent concern to have especially when you’ve already experienced it. I think whilst they are all feminists they’re quite open minded with some things and I do test the water every now and then. The other day I actually mentioned when they were all talking about feminism, I said that I didn’t believe in the word feminism because the word inherently excludes men. They then told me feminism is about equality for men and women and I discussed how a lot of men can’t get on board because of the word bias of ‘fem’ and that if it was so important to women to have men on board with equality, surely they could be more reasonable on the word and compromise with ‘equalitist or humanist’. They understood where I came from with that and they also entirely understood where I was coming from with the Tshirt in the original comment.

&gt;I guess I just get worried about debate because I’d want to come into an educational debate with definitive facts and I’d be worried I’d forget everything- I guess I just need to build up my confidence. I think another thing is that a girl who I used to be friends with and who I used to live with was like an extreme feminazi- she used to talk about tolerance, but was super argumentative and anytime I didn’t agree with something she said, she’d pretty much beat me with her debating skills- I swear to god she would make up statistics but I could never remember statistics when she would get heated. I hate conflict so stuff like that I think has knocked my confidence when it comes to debating. Hopefully I’ll get there one day when I keep testing the waters with small comments and insights.

&gt;The word is actually egalitarian, which is what i am since i am a woman. I have met many feminists in my time (I sound old as fuck. 😂 I am only 25) and i know how they work. Whenever you feel something is off about a particular statistic, always question them on it. ""I will need some proof on that."" Nine times out of ten, they will avoid to answer. That means that their statistic is bullshit.

&gt;It takes time and patience to look for the right counterargument when it comes to things like this. Sometimes, they like to do ad hominem attacks. I am sure you know what those are.

&gt;Feminism has long since died. This new wave feminism is like a tumor that keeps festering because of morons that you see on Tumblr but luckily, they have been eating themselves so i am just waiting until they do.

&gt;As an old broad, I can tell you that feminism wasn't always like this - or at least, the vast majority of us who supported feminism weren't like this. It used to be about being free. Now it's about hatred, and blaming. I stopped calling myself a feminist a while ago - ""social justice has nothing to do with justice, and it's thoroughly antisocial!


&gt;Kasdeja 
&gt;First off I'm sorry that any of that happened, like as if the act it self wasn't enough people attacked you till they deplaformed you in their stupid group think, it sucks and it's unfair that you had to suffer that. Secondly I'm very sorry that's how you realized the movement is such trash, I learned by talking to people outside my group of thought that ideas aren't all bad, it's just that people think based on either statistics on r rhetoric, and it becomes a dangerous fringe group. I remember not to long ago learning from a mentor of mine how Zapatistas in Mexican jungles form their own communities and one of their commanders started a fight for women's equality, they all live by the sword and work by the plow to get their children to a better economic standards of f living. Men and women working hard defending themselves and each other from tyranny. Comandante Ramona was the next I think. That's what I believe. Feminism looks like, or looked like. It's definitely a needed movement where women are an oppressed minority. After seeing the guerrillas and their cause I found sjw movements very disturbing, they fight for no one and are a self serving tool for people with high insecurity and low self esteem to even the playing field, with well adjusted adults. I don't know where I was going with that story (mainly because while telling it I forgot) but I'd like to believe that my point was you can still be a reasonable liberal, or more moderate or even right leaning and the main point is that you live your life in a way you like and corresponds to you and people should never resort to insulting you to that degree, any feminist who blames you for your own rape has lost touch with reality, has damaged both Amy credibility they once had and will have ever again and I'm sorry that happened.

&gt;Literally every woman I know who has been a victim of actual, physical sexual assault HATES the metoo movement. Every one. It trivializes real trauma in an effort to make a bigger boogie man and treats them as victims instead of survivors. Nothing is empowering about that.

&gt;Great post! Glad the entire world hasnt gone crazy.

&gt;I agree the gender pay gap is a myth. People are talking about two different issues there. Women are not making $.70 on the dollar working beside men doing the same job.

​

&gt;Ask them this line of questions and watch them stutter out an answer that makes no sense:

&gt;- Business owners like to make money right? They are the greedy fat cats who are ruining the country according to SJW's so the answer here has to be yes.

&gt;- As a business owner, if you could hire someone at $100/day or $70/day for the same job and same quality of work which would you hire? $70/day obviously.

&gt;- So why wouldnt all business owners hire all women and reduce their labor costs by 30%?

For transparency, I also feel the same way about being liberal (politically, not theoretically). 

I think I’m too scared of committing to one theory or train of thought, because it shuts off other perspectives and ways of seeing the world. This doesn’t mean I don’t believe or follow feminism, it means that I include it into a multi-theoretical perspective (for me).

As we get into it we have to deal with the torn semen-stained underwear of an underage rape victim. Not great. 


Our detective moves up the ranks to become a homicide detective and our first case is a murdered woman. None of the murdered men so far have been nude but this first woman has been splayed out totally nude and brutalised. 


That happening once annoyed me but the next murder case scenario was another murdered and brutalised. She too, was nude. We think there’s a serial killer in town and we are now on to nude bashed women number three. Believe me, they’re all thin with a great pair. 


Why are women portrayed so awfully in this game? It’s clearly there for the titillation of the male gamers. Women cannot escape sexualisation at the hands of men, even in death.

1,So I got accused of being sexist; what do you think?,"Hey,

So I identify myself as an egalitarian and if your definition of it falls synchronously with feminism then yes, I am a feminist. 

I find myself conflicted with a work situation. A little backstory, I'm 30 and an engineering team leader at an MNC engineering company. A few months back we did some hiring of freshers from the university. So I get a couple of fresh people who my assistant engineers  need to train to become fully functional in my team.

So a month goes by and a grievance claim finds it way to my desk from HR. (not against me but filed by a fresher who was in my group). It was from this lady in her early 20s who had just joined our company. She felt that a request from one of my assistant engineers to dress appropriately was sexist and that it wasn't fair.

Naturally I find out what happened. It seems she showed up to an official meeting not dressed per the company code. I sat the assistant engineer in question what was going on. He then shows me a group photo during the session that they took and I found myself inclined to agree with him.

The company dress code is pretty generic on how we dress. For males, its tidy hair, no bright highlights, either clean shaven or well kept beard. Full sleeve shirt (half sleeve allowed as long as its not too informal or graphic tees etc) and long pants. Jeans, skinny jeans, chinos etc all allowed as long as they are not the hip hop kind where half ur underwear is sticking out. Covered shoes. 

For women its pretty much the same. Neat hair that is tied up if its very long (pony tail or buns etc) all acceptable. Naturally curled hair or shoulder length hair is fine as is. Skirts are allowed as long as they are of an acceptable length. Dresses are fine as long as they are ""professional"". This is where it gets ambiguous. Maybe that's why she is arguing.

But this is a Japanese company and we are pretty conservative for the most part (no im not Japanese or conservative but I adapt to my working environment). To explain a little, she was wearing a very low cut sleeveless black dress that to me is more reminiscent of something you would wear to a club or a social night out. The cut on it is almost bareback to top things off. I doubt any man (or woman) would classify this as fit attire for an official meeting. To make matters worse, he now files a complaint to me that this lady was falsely accusing him for being sexist. Now I need to be the middleman between HR and these 2 parties because the chain of command is that I try to mediate first before HR gets involved.

So to dissolve the situation, I talk to this lady and explain to her that all of us, regardless of gender have signed off on a code of conduct that we should adhere to. I also gave her an out by saying that the wording was ambiguous so I am not going to fault her for wearing what she thought was okay. 

So I give her an out, an olive branch or whatever you want to call it, but she refuses to acknowledge that the dress was inappropriate and that as a feminist she feels like what she wears is up to her as long as she feels it is professional. I let it go at that and tell her that I'll refer her grievance to a higher up from HR since I am not able to solve her problem at my level. As I walk out from the meeting room she says she is gona report me for being a sexist too. At this point, I refused to engage any further and told her once again that I would refer her to the appropriate person in HR.

A weeks later, she is fired from the company.

6,Should I have spoken up?,"This was a couple of years ago, but I just randomly thought of it and I thought it could make for a good discussion.

I was working as a bartender, and on this particular night, I was with one other bartender, who is an woman. 

A group of drunk creeps came to the bar and were being *really obnoxious* with her. Lot's of sexual innuendo and cringe-inducing flirting. She laughed at the bad jokes and kept her smile up. Remember, we're bartenders. We're all trying to make good tips. I figured she was just dealing with it to make money. I had personally seen her put up with creeps before to make a few extra bucks, so I didn't say anything. I just kept doing my own thing, work with other guests, clean the bar, etc.

After those guys left, she came to me and our conversation went something like this:

""So why the fuck didn't you help get rid of those guys?""

I was kinda surprised. ""If you needed help you should have came and told me.""

""I shouldn't have to come and get you. You knew those guys were creeps, you should've stepped in. I thought you were a feminist.""

So that kind of irked me, so I may have gotten defensive. ""Unless a guy is reaching over the bar to grab you, I'm not going to jump in and 'save you.' For anything else, come tell me if you need help.""

That's about the size of it. Personally, I think she expected me to be so offended by those guys that I couldn't help but say something, and when I didn't say anything she felt I let her down, but the reason I didn't say anything is because I didn't want to get in the way of her making a living.

16,Why do feminists body-shame men so often? (A question from a male feminist),"This is a question to which I'm especially interested in hearing women's responses. In fact, I'm gonna suggest that any (cisgender) men reading this might want to pipe down unless they have something truly substantive and insightful to say. Also, this post is long and I apologize for that.

It's been explained many times by feminists, as you probably know, that one of the core tenets of feminism is that it benefits men as well as women; it isn't about bringing men down, but raising women up. I've noticed a discrepancy between that idea (which the online feminist community supposedly theoretically agrees on in general) and things they often say about men who do/say sexist or otherwise assholish things. One of the most common examples of this is taunting a man about how small his penis probably is. I just find it hard to square things like this with the principle that people should never disrespect women for any physical ""flaws"" they might have.

And let it be understood that *I agree with that*. I'm not here to say that if women can make fun of guys based on how they look, guys should be allowed to make fun of women based on same, because I hate that at least as much. No one should have to deal with the heartache that results from being treated like that. Even if the one being insulted is the biggest shitpile of a human being anyone has ever known, I don't think it's good praxis to insult them for things they probably have in common with millions of other people who don't deserve it.

It just troubles me deeply to notice that the dominant culture in mainstream feminism is that the most effective way to retaliate to a guy behaving in a way you don't appreciate is to attack him for something that many people are seriously sensitive about and has no real bearing on their worth as a person. It strikes me as casually hypocritical and sophomoric.

Ladies, trans men, what do you think? Can you tell me if there's some sort of logic behind this mentality that makes body-shaming men actually okay when he ""deserves it""? Do you disagree and think it's a toxic trend in feminism that really should die out?

40,"Can someone clearly define white privilege and, if it is real, why it is productive to shame white people for it?","(Sorry for the long post, but this is important.)
When I say define it, I mean to avoid a vague description that doesn't fully encompass what white privilege is. 
My point in asking this is because in my research all I've found is from incredibly biased people that already assume their views to be reality. Someone that believes white privilege to be self-evident, or a conservative-minded person that thinks they are being plotted against. Both do a poor job of defining it.

I personally find doubt in white privilege (and no, I am not white.) 
(Also, I am NOT saying that racism isn't real or that minorities aren't disadvantaged. I just think this is more complex than most people make it out to be.)

You might think it's dumb, but this is my opinion. This term is unproductive in improving the lives of minorities, ostracizing to the white people that want to join your cause, and further builds on the racial divide in our society (imo).

- I don't think that racism automatically means that white people are privileged. Privilege implies that there are inherent advantages in place to benefit one group over another. There are laws in place to protect from discrimination, and others that give minorities an advantage to balance things out (affirmative action). 
- I think there is a difference between being treated fairly and being given privilege. And yes, I think the distinction is important. No one is denying minorities have disadvantages in society. What I am skeptical about is that white people ""live life on easy mode.""
- I see much of the ills that hit minorities as having historical origins. The history of slavery and industrialization serves to partly explain why things are the way they are. Back then there were also laws that targeted minorities, like Jim Crow laws. 
These are examples of institutional racism. They were eventually removed and activism helped to elevate societal perception of minorities like black people. There is still racism, but it has evolved into a social issue, not an institutional one. Society as a whole is not filled with racists, and I don't know how you would go about proving it.

What I think IS an inherent problem is the wealth gap. Since the very beginning of commerce the wealthy have sought to stay in power and control the poor. Wealthy areas have better education, better health, and overall better lives.
There are inherent and institutional advantages to being wealthy. Anyone would think more of a rich black man than a poor white man. Poor white people and homeless white people are still looked down on, rejected, and ostracized. They are judged by their clothes, their neighborhood, their family etc. How do those people have privilege?

Let's say you successfully refute all of this. What does that accomplish? How does that lower crime, or improve education, or increase funding for wellfare? Shaming someone for some invisible advantage they have only makes them feel horrible for being white. That is terrible. No one should be made to feel like that.

These are honest questions, I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just putting my opinion out there.

47,Metal Gear Solid: The Boss,"Anyone here ever play Metal Gear Solid 3? It does fall into a lot of sexist stereotypes, because it's trying to parody James Bond (Snake never gets rapey.

She is never sexualized through the entire game (they do open her top and show some cleavage, but it's to show a horrible scar she has on her abdomen. This woman, and her comrades are (in the context of the universe's story) are the reason the allies won WWII. Her story is very very deep, and emotional, and I just wanted to know how many of you were aware of this character? 

She seems like a very positive example of a positive female character in video games, and honestly, I really would love a Metal Gear Solid game where I play as her, during WWII, and learn her story.

58,PSA + How will you get a handle on our next hoax? An update about bleached manspreaders on the Russian metro.,"This is an unconventional post; a PSA of sorts plus a question on how we deal with this. Many of you will recognize me as a regular here. But more importantly, many of you will recognize a common question we've had recently: [Manspreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9k9klc/manspreading/), [*manspreading*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9k8rac/is_anna_dovgalyuk_a_feminist_an_antifeminist_or/), [**manspreading**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9januv/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this/), [***manspreading!***](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9j5tgv/do_you_think_manspreading_is_that_big_of_a_problem/) Each of those links takes you to a kind of question we've been inundated with here: why are feminists obsessed with manspreading, why are feminists getting violent about manspreading, and the implicit ""feminists know no proportionality."" 

Of course, we've all been very attentive to the details, have explained our thinking about these subjects, and overall have comported ourselves in completely rational if not generous terms to our questioners. But the struggle has been, in so many words, that we've been pushing back against an act and a narrative that we no control over. And surprise, surprise: [the video of the woman in the Russian metro pouring bleach on men is complete theater put out by anti-feminist interests](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/viral-manspreading-video-is-staged-kremlin-propaganda/). The rundown is this:

* [A Saint-Petersberg magazine has interviewed](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpaperpaper.ru%2Fpeterburgskaya-studentka-provela-akc%2F&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url) the man ""bleached,"" and found that he was paid for his performance, he says (from google translate), ""They poured water on us. Plus I slept in the hood too. Naturally, staged. That feeling when you come to the shooting with two spare pants and leave with a salary."" (I wish I read Russian!)

* Now, anyone who knows me knows that I am not a big fan of the ""Putin rigged the election"" or ""Putin commands a troll army"" narrative. I find it much easier to believe that most of these anti-feminist, anti-democracy activities are ""home grown,"" are motivated by bored, angry, malicious, and well-paid people. (Just consider TPUSA, a billionaire funded group of conservative ""campus activists."" But also the gaggle of unpaid teens that have worked for outlets like Breitbart.) But it does look like the group who assembled this video and are broadcasting it through international media are doing so to foment reactionary politics---against feminists, against women, etc. [The video was put on air by Russian state TV, and reactionary politicians used it as a call to arms against progressive politics.](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/viral-manspreading-video-is-staged-kremlin-propaganda/)

Now, the question I put to you is: what do we make of these ""black flag"" operations?

74,Confused on some characteristics of feminism.,"First and foremost, I’m not trying to subject or disregard anyone’s beliefs with this post, I’m looking for help distinguishing one set of beliefs from another.

I’m looking for help distinguishing feminism and egalitarianism. I’m personally an egalitarian, meaning that I believe everyone should have equal rights, equal opportunity, the ability to feel safe/secure where they reside, and live whatever kind of life they desire.

Recently I was speaking with a friend who is an advocate for feminism. Now, under my belief that everyone should have equality, I agreed with almost everything she said. What I disagreed with was when she said that feminism is higher in the hierarchy of beliefs than egalitarianism, which to me, doesn’t seem to add up.

Feminism wants equal rights for women, this I understand. She also went on to say that feminism wants equal rights for men’s issues as well, which is where I believe that feminism becomes egalitarianism based off of the roots of the word. To advocate for men’s/women’s rights and still cal it “fem”inism just seems peculiar to me. Once you start advocating for more than women’s rights, have you not then grown out of the word “feminism,” and would it not be more politically correct to simply call it egalitarianism?

Again, not meaning to say that all feminists should be egalitarian, as I know that those beliefs don’t match everyone’s viewpoint. I’m hoping to have someone well-versed in the term explain the real definition and possibly share their viewpoint on where egalitarianism fits into the chain of belief here.

While this does protect them from accusations of indiscretion, and at the same time protects women from unwanted advsnces. it seems like these types of policies could have a serious adverse reaction to women in the workplace.

84,What Should Be the Punishment For False Sexual Assault Allegations,"   As a former employee of the LA County VWAP (Victim Witness Assistance Program), I understand the need to take claims by those that are sexually assaulted seriously. That being said, in the linked article we see the damages that false claims can have.   


   It's victims can suffer psychological trauma, social stigmatization, interruption to education. Many of these factors can have a detrimental factor to a persons future. This being said, I think that those that are falsely accused should be entitled to a generous monetary settlement funded by the entity that took negative action as well as the public.   


(I.E. In my link, I think that the school admin should be fined (personally) for about $1.5 million. the school itself about $2 million, and the tax payer another $1 million. This would be in additional to the loss of any professional license for those that took action; teacher loses license, the DA is disbarred.  This would be seeking recompense for the lost future of the falsely accused and the social consequences would dissuade injustices.)

86,Feminist thoughts on Andrea Dworkin,"I have been reading some articles by and about Andrea Dworkin ([This is a good source if you're interested](http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OnlineLibrary.html)) and I am finding her to be fascinating.  I have never understood the concept of ""rape culture"" better than I have by reading Dworkin's work.  She comes off like a crazed, bitter woman who has been treated poorly by men for those who don't want to understand (and I would agree that she can be a bit too cynical at times), but if you really try to take in what she says, it's incisive, moving, and brilliant.  As a man I was particularly moved by [this excerpt from her book Intercourse](http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/IntercourseI.html), it explains in a powerful way things that I can never understand.  I think perhaps the most important element I've been considering is the symbiotic relationship between ""good"" men and rapists and how they work unwittingly together to oppress women.   


Dworkin was also vehemently opposed to pornography and libertine sex. S[he believed Pornography to be violence](http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIVC.html) as well as a sort of expression of the societal id.  She also expressed the belief that leftists (particularly leftist men) put too much of an emphasis on impersonal sex and, in such a light, Right Wing Women (the eponymous subject of one of her books) made the logical choice in a society that exploits women and values them primarily for their sex organs to opt for ""privatized male ownership.""  These beliefs appear to me to run counter to the modern feminist zeitgeist that emphasizes enthusiastic consent and sexual liberation.  It would seem to me that Dworkin would consider ""enthusiastic consent"" to impersonal, casual sex to hardly be consent at all.

96,Negotiating consent vs enthusiastic consent,"I have always believed that ""want to do"", ""willing to do"", ""won't do"" is a pretty good idea to discuss sexual boundaries. Of course, some of the ""willing to do"" could move to either ""want to do"" or ""won't do"". And yes, the way to come up with the ""willing to do"" is only by having a conversation on what works for both of you. Your wants and your boundaries may not always be the same. Eg: a man may not WANT to choke the woman but may be willing to do that if she wants it. This can only happen if the woman requests that, and the man has a conversation, before agreeing. Now I'm not saying that begging should be involved, but then again - people beg to be taken back when they're dumped by their partner. So, I don't really feel like pulling my pitchforks for a person going down the route for begging when being refused. And sometimes begging works and the partner who dumped you takes you back. And sometimes she can just say ""pleeeeease, can we go take a vacation?"" and you concede and go take a vacation. 

But some of the recent #MeToo allegations that have swept my country involve women calling out men for begging for some of their ""want to do"" to match her ""willing to do"". Now, I find that it is pretty alright for a woman to say to a man ""I want you to eat me out"", and if the man doesn't like it then she can either request that he do it to her or that she leaves. Or may be she begs until he caves and goes down on her (not an ideal, but not everybody's libidos match up, and you don't want to have a deadbeadroom situiation because an LL and a HL do not always want the same thing or for the same frequency). Why are the women here calling out their ex-boyfriends for begging whether he can ""come on her face"" or requesting that ""she go down on him"" after a tired day's work (for her)?

&amp;#x200B;

One time, one of my ex-girlfriends begged and begged me to buy her some stuff because she wanted to try this cute place once. I caved. Didn't do that again. I don't think I was robbed.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, here's the crux of the question (aside from the one mentioned in the para above): 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should consent be a common (mathematical 'intersection' instead of 'union') list of all the partners' ""want to do"", or a common (again - mathematical 'intersection' instead of 'union') list of ""want to do and willing to do""?
2. Is there really such a thing as ""willing to do"" that you wouldn't consider problematic on some level?
3. Can consent really be negotiated?

97,What to do when someone touches you in public places,"I (21F) am having quite a terrible and stressing week, and when I was in the bus today, some random guy touched my butt while getting in.

But this time I was so fed up with life, I have felt so powerless and frustrated, I really didn't want to ignore it, but I didn't know what else I could do and I just froze.

Maybe calling these things up straight away as they happen, telling the guy ""hey you just touched me"" will somehow embarrass them and avoid it happening again. But I'm not sure, I don't want to start any confrontation, specially because physically I would have no chance in front of any guy.

120,Would you say feminism is hierarchical?,"Just to give some quick context: While I don’t personally identify as a feminist for reasons not really relevant to this question, I am left-of-center economically, far-left socially.  I say this in advance because I’m a bit concerned this could come across as concern trolling.  Nothing I say here is intended to be critical of feminism.

I have a very close friend who is a trans woman, and who suffers from severe anxiety and depression.  I suspect she already had a strong predisposition towards these issues, but I also believe her parents have made the situation far worse.  Now, my friend has a tendency to use feminism (to use her terms) “to justify my existence,” because she thinks she’s somehow an inherently bad person (no this doesn’t make sense, I’m well aware it’s irrational and I’ve spent a lot of time explaining that to her).

Now, the real problem is she tends to misinterpret a lot of feminist talking points.  For example, she believed #whitepeopletears meant that when she cried in the privacy of her own room she was somehow harming minorities.  I had to look it up and explain to her that the hashtag was actually about (as I understand it) avoiding prominent displays of emotions in discussions of race.  My view is that this, and other incidents, were basically just her using feminism to excuse emotional self-harm.

Now, to get to my actual point: whenever I tell her she’s interpreted something wrong, or that she’s taken one person’s view as authoritative without examining it critically, her immediate reaction is to insist that feminism is hierarchical with white people at the bottom of the hierarchy (she also listens to a lot of TERFs to justify putting trans woman at the bottom as well), and it would be wrong of her to even ask anyone higher than her for clarification, or to question anything they say.

Now, examining this view, I googled “feminist hierarchy” and found that everything that came up was from the manosphere.  So, would you say feminism is hierarchical, or is that just another delusion my friend made up to justify her self-harm (I am not trying to be dismissive with the word “delusion,” based on my understanding of the term I believe she meets the diagnostic criteria)?

123,Believe victims and justice,"We hear the phrases “believe the victim” and “there are no perfect victims” a lot, when rape accuser’s characters are called into question on rape accusations, which is a point of contention for feminists trying to combat rape culture.

But rape is a very serious charge. And serious charges require serious evidence. If in the majority of rape cases, you have a crime with no witnesses and no physical evidence, where it is one person’s word against another’s, isn’t a character review really the most relevant thing we could possibly look at to determine who has the best odds of telling the truth? 

Do you think it is good justice that anyone should be able to be convicted of a very serious crime where there is no physical evidence against them and where the only witness has a strong conflict of interest? Don’t you think that the fact that such weak evidence in the majority of rape cases is the reason that not enough cases get prosecuted and not enough rapists are in jail rather than a rape culture? 

If you think that rape is a special case crime where justice should be handled differently (for example, campus tribunals), what makes this crime special that we are expected to not treat evidence with the same rigor as we do other crimes?

If you agree that it is inherently hard for the justice system to deal with rape due to the nature of the crime, and not to do with any secret institutional pro-rape agenda, as I believe, how would you propose we deal with it in a way that respects due process and increases justice for victims?",AskFeminists,1539281566,Whiteliesmatter1,17,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9nce6c/believe_victims_and_justice/,2018-10-11
124,Why is objective science considered a patriarchal concept? What are the alternatives?,"Hi,

Today one of the people I follow on Twitter complained that there was no queer peer reviewed journal in academia where you can't be a reviewer if you claim to be ""objective"". Upon my question what's wrong with being objective, they said that ""objective"" was a patriarchal construct made by white cis-het men and I am not questioning it because I profit from it. Unfortunately they were not interested in further talking about the topic, so I tried to do some research.

It's surprisingly difficult to find something because so many google hits are blogs mocking the authors of those theories without citing or linking them :( Anyway, I did for example find this paper here: [https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2467&amp;context=tqr](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2467&amp;context=tqr) Unfortunately it also barely explains the ""why"", it just states the ""that"". What irritated me the most probably was the following sentence:

""First, the STEM syllabi explored in this analysis promoted the  male-biased STEM institution by reinforcing views of knowledge as static  and unchanging, as it is traditionally considered to be in science,  which is a masculine concept of knowledge (Mayberry &amp; Rose, 1999). ""

I have a background in physics. Physics is a very quantitative, objective discipline. Physics also has very few women in it. Whatever one should make of this. I have next to no experience with gender studies or other philosophical disciplines; I especially don't know how the term ""science"" is coined there. I do, however, get the concept that there can be multiple truths. Alice and Bob both arrive in France. Alice just came from Thailand; she thinks it's rather chilly in France. Bob just came from Iceland, he thinks it's rather hot in France. Both statements are true in their respective frame, no objections from me here.

But what about the statement ""It's 15.8°C in France""? This is an objective fact about reality. Why should it be excluding to women\*? Why is it bad (assuming patriarchal=bad) to search for objective facts? What is the vision of how ""feminist science"" should look like?

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------

\*Considering that the text multiple times refers to a ""chilly"" and ""competitive"" environment as anti-women, one possible explanation I have is that the author thinks that women are naturally less logical and only can thrive in an explicitly cooperative environment.

125,Disagreement w wife over what to teach daughter regarding sexual assault,"First off, this is a serious post and I'm not attempting to upset anyone, only looking for opinions.

 I'm early 30s w a 4mo girl. My wife and I (I am a male) were having a discussion about sexual assault/misconduct and what we'll be teaching our daughter as she grows up. My wife is a survivor of sexual assault and she has very strong opinions on the subject. Her opinions are that we should be doing everything we can to teach boys to become men who do not rape; ""It's not the woman's responsibility to not get too drunk, to not pass out somewhere unsafe, to not 'lead guys on', etc. etc. etc."" she'll say, and I agree 100% we should teach boys this. Where we've had a disagreement is that I believe 'yes means yes' AND 'no means no' should be taught to our daughter simultaneously. 

Take another crime like theft. Most parents teach their kids from the start that stealing is bad. Schools, clubs/teams, babysitters and even extended family reinforce this throughout youth; the criminal justice system, universities, and jobs have clear and robust laws/rules against theft; yet it still happens. A lot. My assumption is that while rapes/assaults will go down if we teach boys from youth not to violate the physical security another and to have positive and continual consent (worthwhile endeavors that should've been undertaken generations ago, IMO) it's not going to eliminate rape. There are just assholes who feel entitled to your phone, your laptop, or your body, regardless of education, upbringing, and cultural views. 

Everyone has a right to feel safe @ any time. I believe this 100%. Your liberty ends at the tip of another's nose. That being said, if I found out my daughter was fond of walking down the street w stacks of $100 bills in her hand shouting ""man it feels good to have $10k in cash on me"", I'd adviser her (or my son if I had one) to not carry so much cash and to never yell that you're holding large sums of money. If she were to continue doing so, and were robbed, it would be 0% her fault, but could've been 100% avoided. This is the same concept I want to teach my daughter w regards to sexual assaults (that my wife is against bc she feels it's no means no and it's not her responsibility to not get raped). Not to be ashamed of herself or that's she's responsible for not being attacked (she wouldn't be), but, teaching her that there are assholes in the world who look to take advantage of ppl. Most of those assholes act like nice ppl until an opportunity presents itself to take advantage of someone. This could be a con artist selling land that's a toxic dump or a bro @ a party who's convinced himself that ""she's loving every second of this."" No amount of education, cultural change, or anything will change this. Out of 7 billion ppl I (maybe pessimistically) believe there's @ least 2 billion assholes @ any given time walking around out there. And I'm an Atheist. I hate the Christian, Muslim, Jewish perspective of ""girls need to cover up to not lead boys astray"" or the not religious but still stupid take of ""well she shouldn't have lead him on"" All of that is garbage, IMO. Yet, I still believe it is wrong to not teach our daughter she could mitigate potential attacks if she only follow some (to me) basic common sense. 

tl;dr 

I believe it best to work to change the rape culture that def exist and is pervasive in society today, but, also teach my daughter to (hopefully) mitigate potential assaults by not placing herself in positions assholes would look to take advantage of (ie passing out @ a party w no one else she knows, etc.) This just makes sense to me but I am open to being wrong.

Now for example let us imagine that exactly the same amount who are taking maths. Since women didn't take maths as much in the past by saying that there are only  ~10% (in around 10 years after the 42% of new profs are female) this would suggest that new women are drastically discouraged when 42% are women.

136,Looking for work advice from a feminist perspective,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for some advice from a feminist perspective if that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a trans woman, and work for a large global company and transitioned officially at work about a year and a half ago.

&amp;#x200B;

My workplace uses a company based facebook style page for communications, and there are multiple different groups set up, one of which is a womens network, which I was unknowingly automatically subscribed to when my details changed.  

About 6 months ago, I got a message from the leader of the group asking if we could meet up for a chat, and I said sure.  I have had no participation in the group other than that single message.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told that she was concerned that my membership was possibly causing a lack of participation from the other members as they did not feel free to express themselves while I was a member.  I said that's fine, i'd voluntary unsub from the group as I didn't actively sign up anyway and didn't want to make others uncomfortable.  She also mentioned that she had noticed I was using the disabled toilet (My decision as it's the only bathroom that's gender neutral), and it was causing issues for some of the women with actual disabilities if I was using the bathroom and they needed to go, and could I not just use the mens room anyway.  Which I did try, but the looks I got in there made me pretty uncomfortable.  

So now i'm having to trek over to the other side of the building to use the mens room over there, as it is very rarely used by anyone and I can get in and out quick... but my manager has pointed out that when I go pee, it takes me about 20 mins (it's a big site) as opposed to 5 mins if I was using the loo in the same building.

&amp;#x200B;

I obviously need to raise the reason why with him, but I'm not sure how to do so without being painted as a troublemaker, or getting anyone else in to trouble.

For example if a man is assualted in public, people will more likely think he desevers it and victim blame him.

In film and media and IRL, when a man is forced into having sex with mostly laughed at or  when satutory rape commited by a female teacher is seen as a great thing for the kid. A lot of people will victim blame the kid as well
They also are seen to never be too drunk to consent and they can never be victims of martial rape

I find both of these ideas convincing but males biology makes them more violent and want sex on average.

I just found out that I've been metoo'd by an ex for being a creep, not understanding the concept of 'no, 'personal space' and 'public space'. I'm lost, devastated, and I don't know what to do. Now this is the same girl that had she and I not broken up, we'd have been married by now (she told her parents about me, which in my country is code for ""yep, he's the guy""). Oh, and she did discuss marriage with me too. And our break up was less than pleasant. We've subtweeted each other since unpleasantly, and I've also gone to therapy because how devastating it was for me when we broke up.

Here's our background: This was two years ago and we're both in different cities. She and I flirted on Twitter and she DM'd me. The conversation went very sexual and on the areas of kink (she used to call me 'daddy' and everythjng, which was totally her call). I was an amateur kink practitioner (interested in it fully, but I didn't actually use instruments and occasionally spanked and did other minor things). But we did discuss what we'd do to each other when we finally met all the time

Here are the incidents that she's talking about:

1. When we met finally for the first time, we ate a little, walked around about a kilometer or two to a pub, and on realizing that the elevator to the pub was empty, I went in for kiss (90-95%). She said ""Oh no"", but then kissed me back (moves the remaining 5%). For reference, I made a move just like this on a date where I went in (90-95%), and she didn't do her ""5-10%"". I backed off, and didn't initiate

2. I kept occasionally kissing her while in the pub. We spoke for hours. She kept kissing me back. I didn't get any vibes to suggest that she was uncomfortable. At the end, I took her to my old college's campus and spoke for hours. At the end when I wanted to say goodbye, I went in for the kiss, and she kinda gave me a hug and left. While in her cab she texts me that she really dislikes PDA and then we spoke about the date, and how outside of PDA, she loved the date and we again spoke for hours. 

3. After texting her that I'm in the city for Christmas asking if she wanted to catch up (I already asked by this point if she wanted to be my girlfriend - she said yes), I met her for lunch, and walked around in the park. In the park, I kept my hand on her butt as we're walking. She told no. This was my fault because I took that it wasn't loud so I did it one more time (I intended to be playful)

4. A. When she finally came to visit me, we decided to have sex. She told me that she was coming home to jump my bones. During the sex, I had a hard time getting hard (my pelvic floor was fucked up from bad form in capoeira and I threw my back out, and additionally I was exhausted from 5 days of travel. I realize the hilarity of long form text defending my 'soldier down' moment as I type this). We tried The kink play (with the whips and the gags and the cuffs). I'll admit that I asked her if it was okay to put the gag in her mouth after she told me a few minutes ago that it hurts. 

4. B. I also begged her for anal. We had a joke based conversation on how she wanted me to send her a long form written note on why she should have anal with me. After we realized that me getting hard was a lost cause, she kept suggesting that I buy a viagra. I told her that I wasn't comfortable with it. But eventually I relented and told her only if she has anal with me. She said yes, and I bought the pill. And we had anal sex. Hours later, after telling each other the L word (I really did love her) and dropping her off at the bus, I got a terrible reaction in my heart and ended up in a hospital, and I guess I may have put her in a tough spot by asking her to get off and come back (I genuinely thought I was going to die).


Here's my question: What do I do now? I apologized to her after she told me that she didn't like the anal, the asking to put the gag in her mouth a few minutes after she told that it hurts and she going along, the PDA of our dates. We broke up mostly because of this, and the fact the we got into a silly fight over a stupid issue (she unfollowed me) and me going ahead and DMing another girl with a lot of flirty overtones.

I realize that what I did wasn't ideal. I'm not sure if this was MeToo level of un-ideal, and I really want to understand/know. I mean, she did coerce me into buying a viagra that put me in a hospital (which she now claims with pride in her tweet). I mean, it's not like she was a saint. She laughed at me after begging me to share a shirtless picture of me (which really made me self-conscious). She begged me to share a picture of my dick (which I never agreed to but that didn't stop her from asking). Am I wrong in assuming that if you concede after the other party begs then, while un-ideal, it isn't really harassment? While I understand that putting your hand on your girlfriend's butt is wrong if she doesn't want it in a certain area, was I terrible for trying be cheeky (When I wasn't sure how serious it felt to her)? I stopped after she told me to stop (I may have pouted a little).

Sorry for the rambling.

166,Why did toxic masculinity develop?,"My understanding of toxic masculinity is that it's the social suppression of stereo-typically feminine characteristics and the corresponding exaggeration of stereo-typically masculine characteristics.  I had pretty caring parents, and I've grown up to have a relatively strong feminine side.  I'm caring, affectionate, I cry if I feel emotional, I seek help from others and I'm bringing up my children with the same care I received from my parents.

That said, I've grown up along side many men who were the epitome of toxic masculinity and while I can see substantial downsides to it (propensity to social problems, inability to connect with people fully, higher likelihood of alcohol addiction and higher rates of violence) I can also see that in some circumstances and at certain historical times, toxic masculinity was probably a desirable attribute.  

One thing that was very obvious to me, growing up, was that men like me who were socialized to be caring were not only less likely to be violent but also far less capable of being violent even if the situation may have warranted it.  In a well regulated, policed, social democracy, men like me have an advantage in that violence is rarely called for and there's lots of upsides to being caring and connected.  However, in other situations, like a prison or a war zone I can see that toxic masculinity might be advantageous.  I think if I was drafted and forced to participate in a situation where violence was about to take place, my very first instinct would be to find someone who was conventionally ""toxic"" who might be able to help me survive.  It's no accident that the world's military's engage in so called ""beasting"" which seems to me to be an explicit ""toxification"" of men, understanding that only men who are capable of violence will actually be useful to them in combat.  They're well aware that in the wars of the 20th century almost all the killing was done by a very small percentage of the men, most of whom were so uncomfortable with violence that they'd aim to miss or simply hunker down trying to ride out the situation.

Even though this sub, is very likely frustrated that toxic masculinity even still exists, toxic masculinity has clearly been on the decline for some time now.  Even the differences between the first and second world wars seem to me to show some clear reduction in toxic masculine attitudes.  The fact that men were not shot for cowardice in the second world war for example seems evidence of this.  I think the fact that we've lived through an unprecedented period of peace for the last 70 years is probably linked to the changes in attitudes.  In essence the more a society is dependent on warrior cultures existing for its survival, the greater the likelihood that toxic masculine attitudes will be encouraged.

So sorry for expounding for a while, here's some questions:

1. Do you agree that toxic masculinity might make men more effective at violence as well as more likely to engage in it?
2. Do you agree that in our tribal past, violence may have been required to compete over the scarce resources which existed for our ancestors?
3. If our society ever runs into a situation were resources are scarce again, do you think economics will drive a resurgence of toxic masculinity?",AskFeminists,1539508972,SexWomble,9,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9o1hrq/why_did_toxic_masculinity_develop/,2018-10-14

Quick question. I'm not talking about somebody who is manipulating a girl to just get sex, where the girl has already turned down the person. 

The scenario I have in mind is: guy falls for girl, girl rejects guy by wants to remain friends. Guy accepts this friendship but deep down he is hoping that it might lead to something more later on down the line. I.e, the guy is hoping that by remaining in the so called ""friend zone"" the relationship might ""naturally"" blossom into something more.

184,My friend's ordeal (long story + questions at the end),"So there's this friend of mine. We'll call him ""Vance"", because Vance is a cool name and he's a cool dude. (His real name is cool too, but I'd like to protect his anonymity.)

Years ago, he was raped. A girl cornered him and propositioned him for sex, and he said no because he was already in a relationship with someone else. She told him that if he didn't put out for her, she'd tell everyone she knew that he raped her. Knowing that he didn't have a choice, he had sex with her, and tried to report the crime to the police afterwards. The police pretty much told him to piss off and stop wasting their time.

To this day, his rapist still shows up at his place of work every now and then and brags to his coworkers about having fucked him. She hasn't suffered any repercussions for her crime and probably never will - at least not in any official capacity.

Fast forward to earlier this year. Vance was in a gender studies class, and one day the teacher decided to put the class through a peculiar exercise. For the entire period, the male students would be disallowed from speaking. If they had something to say, they'd have to whisper it to a female classmate, and she would speak for him. The purpose, from what I can tell, was to demonstrate to the men in the class how women are often silenced and talked over, with their words not taken seriously.

The exercise *really* upset and frustrated Vance, which his teacher took quite a bit of pleasure in. Thing is, she had no idea he was raped, and assumed that he was just getting salty that his privilege was being thrown in his face. In truth, the exercise was reminding him of the *other* time he tried to speak up and was silenced - about his rape. I guess you could say he was triggered.

Here are my questions:

1. Were Vance's feelings of anger and sadness understandable?
2. Conceptually, do you think that the exercise is a worthwhile one? 
3. Should Vance have talked to the teacher after class about why the exercise upset him?

He says things like ""You need to dress well and learn how to carry yourself in your clothes"" (I do have a good sense of fashion as told by a lot). He keeps telling me that women should not wear shorts cause it means that they are using their bodies to go forward in life while he himself posts shirtless pictures of himself everyday on fb(not that I am objecting). I recently found out that he had been chatting to a girl on his phone and their chats are kind of personal. He used to have a crush on this girl and he also chats to random girls but if I ever get a text from a guy (I never reply) he will give me the silent treatment and treat me like shit. He checks my phone too even though I am not allowed to touch his. That's my side of the story.
His side is that I am depressed and cut myself. I have been struggling with depression for a while and yeah a lot of people would consider me undatable. He keeps saying ""you use depression and cutting to manipulate me"" whenever I tell him about it (well.. Once I got in a ugly fight with him and he gave me the silent treatment as usual .. It was over the fact that he would not accept my fb request and I would have not cared if he wasn't commenting on other girls pics. I don't really like social media anyways and I was also having a particularly worse day than usual and all this made me want to cut. He asked me later what was I doing and pressured me into telling him that I cut. I promised him that I would never lie about it so now whenever I feel like I am on the verge of it, I tell him and he accuses me of trying to manipulate him even though I have clearly told him that if he ever need to get out of the relationship, he is under absolutely no pressure to stay cause mental illnesses can be exhausting to deal with and I understand). He keeps saying that he will be in trouble if I die and that people will talk trash about him and he won't be able to get a job or anything. He also wanted me to live with his parents after getting married and accused me of abuse when I told him I would not (his parents won't let me wear western clothes or be an atheist). One other guy has also accused me of abuse because I won't sleep with him. He says that I am abusing him by making him feel that being sexual is wrong and that I am taking fake pride in saving myself for marriage (all I said was that he should find a girl who is into having sex with him).

It feels like there is two stereotypes of male feminists: either the 'self flagelating white knights who hate themselves for the sin of being born with a penis', or the 'sexual predator in disguise'

I am neither of these things. But I dont want to have to be associated with either stereotype, and as such I dont call myself a feminist. I do not use it as an excuse for why women should have sex with me because I'm a ""Woke Bae"", and I also will not hate everything about my entire gender. Men have far too much disproportionate power in society, but I will not constantly put myself or other men down because of it.

219,Interested in what this sub thinks about this therapist on assault and teens.,"I need to apologise for my last few questions being personal questions.

This question isn't about me, but if allowed, I do need to add some back story. 

The other night, during a period of OCD, I had posted about a time where my arms had touched beneath my my girlfriend's breasts while she was laying on me. Because she didn't say anything and we were rather close, I didn't move my arm. We were 17. 

Years later, I called and asked if she had felt uncomfortable and she replied she wished I had done that kind of thing more often. I was worried, however, that I had assaulted, because I didn't have express permission, her and she just happened to like it.

This sub explained implied consent to me and that it would've been assault if she had pushed me away. I asked if the initial touch still counts as assault and the sub responded along the lines of it being an unnecessary risk, but still not assault.

So, the actual question: My therapist today said that even if I had touched her breast, and she had moved my hand away, it would've only been assault if I kept at it. That it's ""normal teenage overzealousness"" to ""find limits"".

Basically, if a boyfriend grabs his girlfriend's breast thinking it was okay, she moves his hand, and he doesn't do it again, it's not assault.

This still sounds like assault to me. What about you all?",AskFeminists,1539742435,BromineHahnium,13,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9oucd1/interested_in_what_this_sub_thinks_about_this/,2018-10-16

But one so many facebook news posts about the issue from Huffington Post and other usually left wing pages, so many people are mocking her discomfort at the video and are using her past as a porn model as reasoning for her to just accept her image being used in a sexual manner without her consent. Despite Melania expressing problematic views about sexual assault, why are a-lot of the anti-sexual harassment crowd now using sexist bullying against her. Is it now alright for certain people to get sexually harassed because you don't like them? ""/s"" Like seriously even if you hate a person, you shouldn't ever resort to slut-shaming.

222,"I am an autistic male. I find it difficult to read or understand subtle cues from people, including wonen.","So I've been reading a few articles recently surrounding the controversy of harassment and women's issues, [including this piece](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/sexual-harassment-me-too-flirting-westminster-scandal-harvey-weinstein-ruining-dating-a8031866.html?amp), and it's brought up some thoughts in my mind. The article I have linked talks about the differences between what women consider flirtatious and what they consider harassing, and to me some of the things they described would be hard for me to ""detect"", let's say, as a person with ASD. In particular, my concern is whether my advances towards women would be welcome or not. As a disclaimer, I would never go up to a woman and say ""eyy U're bangin let me fk u"", I'm much more polite than that.

Basically, if a woman was to be upfront and tell me that they were or weren't interested, I'd be completely fine with that. It's just that I have problems with understanding subtle expressions and gestures and things like that, which can sometimes make it hard to tell whether someone is interested or not based on those things.

Also, as a bit of a side vent, I don't really get how you're supposed to get with people when you're not really supposed to flirt at work? Because as someone who doesn't get out much, but is thinking of getting a job soon, my workplace would be like my main source of social interaction.

For example, a friend of mine is very sexually open. She told me once that I should totally touch her breasts just to feel them and ""explore"" them in her own words.

230,Is there a reason why I cannot describe a woman in particular as being childish?,"Hello. To give you a little backstory, I am a guy (mid 20s). Just like most millenial guys, I like to think that I’m a feminist, which heavily depends on who you ask. I went out on a date few months ago, and We ended up talking about the movie Frances Ha. We both had generally positive reviews and she had a very interesting take on the movie, having studied gender and women’s studies in college. I told her that I thought of it as a well executed coming of age movie, and I also told her the main character Frances was childish at times. This is when she said I shouldn’t describe a woman childish. I was baffled because I thought majority of the characters in the movie, not just women, were childish. I asked her why I shouldn’t but she said it would be too hard to explain. I guess from my perspective being childish isn’t just necessarily a bad trait and I would say I’m childish at times too.
So now my question is, what would be some good reasons why it is not good to describe Frances or woman in general as being childish? Also if that is the case, doesn’t that imply that we shouldn’t use the word childish in general to describe adults?

237,Career ladies: how do you motivate underachieving male staff?,"Disclaimer: I REALLY don't mean this in a misandrist way – quite the opposite. I just don't know how to deal with this problem effectively, and I'm really frustrated.

I’m a career-focused mid-twenties woman. I have a full-time job, am enrolled on a full-time postgraduate programme, and work for a charity in my free time. I also try hard to be there for the people in my life, and maintain an active social life and a successful and loving relationship. No kids yet haha – something will definitely have to give when that becomes a priority, but for now I’m living the work-hard-play-hard millennial dream.

I have been fortunate to have a number of leadership roles already in my short career. In various jobs, I’ve been in charge of three young men who were around my age. They’ve all been recent graduates, and have fallen straight into purposeful, interesting jobs that require a high degree of responsibility, with great work/life balance to boot. These jobs are anything but boring. I’ve also worked alongside three other men with similar profiles who I can think of off the top of my head. 

I’ve noticed an irritating trend in these dudes:

1. They’re pretty nice guys, and pleasant company in a social sort of way. They identify as feminists, and I genuinely like them as people. This makes it hard to challenge their behaviour in a matter-of-fact way.
2. They have all been master’s educated, but have never had paid work prior to these posts.
3. They're really big on the boundaries of work hours. They're all unwilling to work even minimal overtime – not even five minutes longer than they are required. Even if they’re in the middle of a time-sensitive task, AND got to work late, AND faffed about in the kitchen for half the day. Overtime is absolutely non-negotiable for these dudes.
4. They’re all very bright and capable. They brag about how easily they learn new tasks, but complete the basic, administrative ones to a VERY poor standard.
5. They are unable to take on constructive criticism delivered in a typically female, indirect and friendly fashion (“perhaps we could work more on this?”). They challenge the criticism, and if I push to discuss further, they deflect. The conversations are unproductive, and I end up having to correct their work EVERY time I deal with it. 
6. They struggle to hit deadlines, in part because THEY WON’T EVER WORK OVERTIME and don't manage their time well in the boundaries of their working hours.
7. They will openly complain to me about how boring they find the base-level responsibilities of their job, as if that’s an excuse to not complete required tasks. They use really negative language to get across their frustrating about how boring they find these things.
++++++++

Now, the last one really gets me. When I graduated from my master’s degree, I worked for a year as a receptionist, and had an unpaid side gig for eight months of that time, before any employer would touch me with a ten foot pole. I hated my job so much I cried on the way to work every. single. day. I was treated like I was stupid by my colleagues and by our clients. I had such limited responsibility, I basically just scanned, photocopied, and filed paperwork when I wasn’t at the front desk. But I completed my job to a high standard. I was professional, and it paid off.

These guys have never worked in a shitty job, and moan openly, TO THEIR MANAGERS, about how they’ve fallen into fantastic roles in their early twenties. God forbid they use their fancy educations to actually contribute to society.

When I came across my first one, I thought he was just a fluke. But I’ve managed two more guys like this, and I know SO MANY others.

The most recent dude is one that works at my level. I’m training him how to do a high-level task to fill his time with, because as it stands, he mostly resolves issues as they come up. That means he often won’t be working during his hours, and has had a lot of time to surf the web, etc, presumably.

++++++++

I actually had this conversation during training for a new task that is really important and actually pretty fun:

** conversation is reconstructed and names have been changed to protect identity**

Me: So how did you find the task? 
Dudebro: Yeah it was really easy.
Me: Did you enjoy it?
Dudebro: Not really. It was pretty boring.
Me (after an awkward moment): Okay… what, specifically, did you dislike about it?
Dudebro: I dunno. I guess it was just really easy and I don’t really see the point.
Me (after explaining why it’s important): So, let’s try to find a solution to this problem. What do you enjoy most about your job?
Dudebro: Ummmmmm…. (awkward silence) Well I guess I like (irrelevant thing that isn’t part of his role). 
Me: Okay… but that’s not really part of your role as I understand it. Is that something you’d like to be doing?
Dudebro: I mean, not really.
Me: okay……………
Me: Well, okay. Let’s take a different track. What do you like about your day-to-day life? 
Dudebro: (Tells me about hobby)
Me: Have you thought about letting the team know that you have those skills, to see if we could make use of them?
Dudebro: Noooooo. 
Me: Okay, that would be a good step. (Silence)
Me: And what do you not like about your job at the moment?
Dudebro: Well I hate resolving issues. But I guess that’s what we’re paid for.
Me: Okayyyyyyyy… And, what steps do you think we could take to help you enjoy this particular task a bit more? 
Dudebro: I mean, I guess the main thing would be to make sure my workload isn’t this heavy.
Me: :O :O :O

This dude often has ENTIRE DAYS where he does NOTHING. And he’s stressed about his work-life balance.

Need I remind you that I WORK FULL-TIME I STUDY FULL-TIME I HAVE A BOYFRIEND I HAVE FRIENDS I HAVE A CAT I AM A HUMAN WOMAN WITH RESPONSIBILITIES and the implication here is that HE IS TOO GOOD TO DO THIS TASK and so the ENTIRE WORKLOAD SHOULD BE MINE AND I SHOULD HAVE TO WORK OUTSIDE OF HOURS. :O :O :O 

+++++++

In my last management position, I got round this problem by becoming the cool-I’m-your-friend boss. I actually protected my direct report from criticism by upper management, and worked crazy overtime to correct his mistakes when anybody else would have just fired him. I REALLY liked him as a person, and he was quite a sensitive soul, so I had a lot of empathy for him. We're good friends now, and I'm super glad I don't manage him anymore.

So my question to you guys: 

1. How do I deal with this in a way that is sensitive to this kind of overeducated and underachieving young man? It’s frustrating for me, but at the end of the day, I realise that they’re equally frustrated and are chomping at the bit for more responsibility. You can see from the above that I try to keep the conversation positive, and I pride myself in being a good motivator in the workplace, but that doesn't seem to work. 

2. How do the above without becoming a pushover in the workplace? I don’t want to clean up lazy team members’ messes, but I also don’t want to throw people I like under the bus!

243,% of 2nd Wavers versus 3rd Wavers,"I have been wondering what the % of feminists are in the different schools or waves.

&amp;#x200B;

**2nd Wave**: At the moment, this is only radical feminism from what I can tell. What I really wish to know is what % of feminists are radfems. Opposition to prostitution, sex work, porn, BD/SM, the beauty industry, masculinity/femininity, and transgenderism, particularly transwomen, seem to be the hallmarks, although some radfems support transgender people. Also known as TERF's and SWERF's. Take a very hard line.

&amp;#x200B;

**3rd Wave:** Intersectional feminism. Also choice feminism. Support for femininity and the beauty industry if feminists wish act feminine or use those products. Support for prostitution, sex work, porn, BD/SM, and transgenderism. In general, take a softer line than radfems.

&amp;#x200B;

There also exist 1st wavers (Equity feminists) and 4th wavers (same as 3rd wave apparently). Let us leave them out for now.

&amp;#x200B;

I would say they hate each other, but most of the hostility seems to be coming from radfems towards 3rd wavers, whom they deride as ""fun feminists."" For the most part, 3rd wavers simply ignore radfems, refuse to talk about them, wave them away, minimize them, etc. There's not nearly as much hostility here as the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

3rd wavers sometimes say that radical feminism is a tiny movement, but that does not seem to be the case. The media, universities (Women's studies especially), and battered women's shelters are full of radfems. In addition, there are quite a few in the legal profession. According to this argument, \~5% of feminists are radfems. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have reason to believe that the number of radfems is greater than that. Feminist Current is a radfem website. It is the largest feminist site in Canada, and it is closing in on being the biggest site in the US. The Gender Critical subreddit is very popular. They say they are the biggest feminist subreddit, but I don't think that is true. A prominent radfem I talked to did not give me a %, but the impression I got was 35-40% radfems, 60-65% 3rd wavers.

&amp;#x200B;

So radfems are anywhere from 5-40% of all feminists and 3rd wavers are 60-95% of feminists.

&amp;#x200B;

You might think this is a dumb question, but it might be nice to know what % of feminists fall in the various waves.

&amp;#x200B;

245,"Is there any merit in making the ""rejection gap"" a feminist issue?","I am a man and when I ask around my acquaintances, I realize that women get rejected romantically a LOT less than men. Most women I asked never even asked anyone out and just said ""yes"" or ""no"" when they were asked out. The few that did make the first move almost always got a positive answer, the most rejections one of my female acquaintances had was 5.

It's another story on the men's side, even the hottest dudes I know had more than five rejections in their life and the ugliest ones (myself included) are in the 30s/40s.

Another way to measure this rejection gap is by looking at online dating like tinder. In [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/fashion/tinder-the-fast-growing-dating-app-taps-an-age-old-truth.html?_r=0) , it says men swipe right 46% of the time whereas women only 14% of the time. Since there is a 50/50 gender ratio on tinder, it means women are getting a shitload more matches than men.

Over and over, studies come out showing that relationships are so much more important than a career or salary for someone's happiness, and the scale of this ""rejection gap"" is much more extreme than the scale of the pay gap. Could reducing this rejection gap be a major feminist issue?

If yes, would you encourage women to be less selective and swipe on more than 14% of men on tinder, or should it be the men that need to be more selective and swipe right on less than 46% of the women?",AskFeminists,1539943932,bcat124,55,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9pigqz/is_there_any_merit_in_making_the_rejection_gap_a/,2018-10-19

248,I do not think I have male privilege.,"Not saying it does not exist but as a man I definitely do not have it. I realized I was gay at a young age. Never told anyone because I grew up in a very strict Christian household that probably would have sent me to conversion therapy if they found out. Been and out psych wards most of my teen years for suicide attempts and self harm because I hated myself for being gay. I felt disgusting. Like God was going to punish me for it. One day in an emotional state I told my parents. They were not pleased. They started telling me it was a sin and that if I didn't repent that I'd go to hell but that they could ""help"" me get over those feelings. When I refused I had to move out into my brothers house. From when I first knew I was gay and heard an anti-LGBT sermon in my church I thought ""I wish I was a girl. Then I'd be straight and God and my parents wouldn't hate me.' Being male actually held me back in this aspect of my life. To this day I still wish I was a girl  because then I would have my parents love again and I wouldn't feel the need to hide my sexuality to them, my friends or society and most of all I wouldn't have felt like I was an unnatural freak that god hates all of my childhood.

5,Dating advice/General advice,"Exposition:

 Im a white guy, please hear me out and bare with me, to be completely honest I hate being a guy now. My dad left my family when I was a child so I never had any male figures in my life,  so I never learned about masculinity and luckily I was sheltered enough to avoid toxic figures. I never learned about how to deal or cope with my emotions, and consequently I never learned how to cope with severe depression. Luckily, up until recently, most people in my life have been open-minded and were willing to approach me and offer a friendly chat which was more than enough for me to feel accepted, since my mother viewed me with the same hatred she had for my father, purely because I was a guy (learned this as an adult after I talked to her after I nearly took my own life). Aside from the rare friendly chats with strangers, I never gotten anything close to compassion and at this point to be completely honest I probably wouldn't even be able to recognize it at this point in my life and it is probable that I wont ever. I have never been part of a real community, White culture tends to throw me out to the curb on a regular basis since I don't really ""act white"" whatever that is supposed to mean, and other groups wont even say hello because I am white. Girls are afraid of me, especially nowadays, purely because I am a white male. 

I am not ignorant to the hardships literally everyone else has had to suffer through, but I will also never truly be able to experience the same troubles and hardships that every gender and race has had to undergo. Even if the same institutions were flipped on their heads, it would never be the same experience. I never approach women anymore, largely because I was never conditioned to do that kind of thing, but also now because I am public enemy #1 based on what I am rather than who I am. Every action I make is put under the microscope and if there is even the slightest atomic hint that I want to open up and be friends (not even dating, just friends) I am shut down and ignored. I am not saying its wrong, in more ways than people think I do get it, and no matter what anyone says you cannot change the past or what my kind has done to everyone. 

The main point of the exposition is that I have always been alone, I have always been judged and ignored, thrown to the curb because of what I am. Especially nowadays that most people would rather people like me be cleansed so that the demons of the past can be forgotten and society can move on. I am not blaming anyone for this, for women I understand the hatred, and for any ethnic group I understand the hatred towards people like me. 

So finally here is the Question for you Feminists:

This is not just for me, but for people like me too... What am I supposed to do? 

I'm not valuable to literally anyone. No one needs me, and that isn't a complaint towards any group or gender or anything. Everyone has the potential to do and be amazing things and they can do it themselves with the right support groups, and if people are willing to take a chance on them. 

I'm not trying to ""mansplain"" (even though the word is extremely toxic, I get why people use it). What am I supposed to do? I hate what I am, I hate that I was born, and I hate how everyone views me when no one is willing to take a step back and see people for who they are... 

I can't step up and talk to women without getting a novel of rhetoric shoved down my throat over history I am already aware happened and I am not a part of. I can't be a nice human being and do nice things for people anymore without everyone jumping the shark over how I am ""exploiting"" the non-existent power I have. 

What am I supposed to do? 

How am I supposed to approach women nowadays? I am totally willing to give up my supposed ""power"" and step to the sidelines and let Women take control of the dating pool, and I even have already done that. But if I don't step up, no one will and I will in all high likelihood live and die alone.

7,"If the feminist movement had a leader, in the vein of Martin Luther King, what would she be like?","I'm curious to know everything about her - How does she unite the different feminist groups, or does she care to? As a minority leader, how does she appeal to the majority? How would she win them over, inclusion? And if she wasn't trying to enlist the majority's support ultimately, what other route would she take to create real, tangible change? How does she involve men or uninvolve them?

What advice would she promote to mothers on raising their sons, and daughters at that? What kind of events would she organize to bring people together, to make the movement's desires heard? Protests, would she ever condone violence of any kind? What laws would she change, get rid of, add?

It shouldn't matter what she wears, or who she dates, I get it, please don't go there. I'm asking anyways. As a public leader, everything about her has an effect and will be under scrutiny.

13,Is radical feminism shaming women for the choices they make?,"Liberal feminism by far the most effective movement in advancing women's rights and is inclusive to many women who might not be politically or ideologically interested. 

My definition of liberal feminism is that it wants to reform within the system to make women equal to men, but also gives choice to women whereas the more radical ones wants to dismantle the system and shame women who like make up and take decisions for women instead of letting women choose by themselves. Also, how do you dismantle the system? What's the plan? How much support does radical feminism have among women? To dismantle the system you need all women on board, but most women do not define themselves as radical feminists. 

For example, most radical feminists are in favor of a ban on prostitution despite the fact that many sex workers who are mostly women themselves have spoken out about the repercussions of that by being stigmatized, not having legal rights and not having medical check ups which are absolutely necessary to be healthy. While prostitution is enforcing the idea of women being a commodity to be bought and owned for sexual purpose, sexual workers should not be criminalized and stigmatized. 

This example shows that radical feminism is pure ideology and not so much women solidarity. Another facet of radical feminism is the transmisogyny that often shows up and the groups absolute obsession in calling transwomen sexually deviant and mentally ill.

Now, let's not fool ourselves that liberal feminism is happy sunshines and rainbows, but I rather be part of a movement that encourages women of all kinds (yes and that also includes transwomen) and who do not moralize over the personal choices some women make (wearing make up, being a sex worker, watching porn, staying home with children etc).

17,Is the mainstream feminism about not discriminating only because of gender?,"I am a man. I knew the word ""feminism"", and I thought I was more of a feminist because I think women should not receive unjust treatment just because they are women. But recently there seems to a lot of negative sentiment about feminism. Not just crazy ignorant guys, but an educated scientific guy like Thunderf00t. I had been avoiding his feminism videos, But lately, I happened to have watched some anti-feminism videos on YouTube, and in most cases, they made sense. That was not the feminism I thought of.

For example, Serena Williams' claim about sexism was completely unjustifiable, and honestly, I felt that she had some sort of delusion of persecution or in a simple term, crazy. Arguing that companies like Google/Facebook/Twitter should hire more women also seemed not justifiable, because I think it was not that they did not hire women because they were women, but because there were few eligible female applicants. It is not Google's fault that few female chose to study computer science in universities. And there were videos of a lot of women who were just angry towards this man-centric society. They were not making calm rational valid criticism, but almost looked emotional. A group of guys had a calm lecture on men's right (not the superiority of men, but about the bad things that some men encounter because they are men), and there were lots of people just yelling to interfere the lecture or trying to block men from entering the classroom. They was unwilling to have a civilised rational discussion, but they just try to shut up men and yelled what they think to them.

21,I haven't been in the feminist environment for a long time. I just wanted to check in for a bit.,"Please bear with me. I'm not looking for a debate or argument because I'm too outdated for that. I also don't intend to be disrespectful. I'm gonna talk a bit about my time on all sides of this spectrum, if that's the right word, as well as why I stopped, blah blah blah. *This is probably gonna be a long post,* so I understand if you don't wanna read a bunch of crap. I know I wouldn't. 😂  

Back in the age of TRIGGER memes, must've been around 2012, 2013, something like that. I was introduced to the idea of feminism as ""equality, etc."" which is probably the ideal mindset you want to promote. I was down with the idea, but I was one of those high school kids who easily procrastinated, or at least I was at the time. So as you could imagine, I did fairly little research on the surrounding aspects of feminism. I would try to list what I mean, but y'know, I didn't do my research. 😂 

At this point, I was very vocal in support of feminism, but the problem was, I was what could be defined as a bad feminist. Like I said, I hardly knew anything. No feminist history, no nothing. All I had was ""We do not hate men! We want equality!"" *Oh btw, I should probably mention that I'm male, for what it's worth.* I even used that line on an ol' website called debate.org which I used because I thought I was sooo smart. And with no sources, knowledge, and defence, I was pretty easily put down by people online, as well as myself. 

Fast forward about another few months of what felt like the worst I've been in regards to my aggression and sensitivity. Eventually I said to myself, ""Gee whiz. I feel as though I have taken too dang long to make little progress in this movement. Boy, oh boy, I sure do wonder what it's like on the other side. Let's investigate what my fellow males wish they could say that I refused to listen to before."" *(not an exact quote)*

So I *removed myself from the side of feminism* and joined my home team, males. ""Hold up, do feminists really hate men?"" To be fair, that's what these guys feel like, and tbh I kinda still understand why many men feel this why. (Which, btw, is how I learned how to understand how all sides of a debate feel before picking sides) But then it started to frustrate me, and I began to really hate feminists. Whaaaat?! Plot twist! 

I think I spent about a year with this new mindset, and I would very often join arguments against both fair feminists, as well as bad feminists. It was a bad way to go down, I know. *But that's not all!* Eventually I realised how far I've sunk and decided to banish myself from this war (so to speak) altogether. That was about 5 years ago, I think. 

Since I left, I've been progressively bettering myself as a person. I have a stonger control over my emotions, I don't judge people by their cover, and I always try to understand how a person or a group feels. 

*Before I bring us back to present day* I want to point out that during my time with and against feminism, there was what I understood to be a conflict between two specific types of people under the wings of the word ""feminism"". Y'all know what I'm talking about. There's the angry ""men are trash"" type, which if I understand correctly is what the Feminazis are, and of course there's the fair ""we just want equality"" type, which I hope this sub is filled with, tbh. 

*Dang, this post is getting long, so let's come back to present day already.* The whole point I'm here is, I just wanted to check in and see how much it's changed, because I've been avoiding all feminism news for years. 

Are the Feminazis still in conflict with Fair Feminists (as I call them)? Is the hate towards feminism any more or less harsh than it used to be? I'm sure I had more questions when I thought of writing this, but I forgot. I'm sure someone might just happen to answer those. 😂

24,Manners vs Sexism,Hello I just ran into an issue at work that happens frequently and I was curious what a feminist perspective would be. I just held a door open for a female co-worker I didn't know who was right behind me. As she walked through she didn't say thank you or even make eye contact with me. That irritated me because I view it as rude to not say thank you. If anyone were to hold a door open for me I say it every single time. But I also get self-conscious about bringing something like that up because of the optics of a man saying a woman was rude for not saying thank you. Is this something that would be appropriate to mention or is this something that would be perceived as bad as I think it would.

36,Is manspreading really a problem?,"I've seen this word used a lot more lately and wanted to elaborate on it. First, is it really something feminists take issue with? Why?

Are you aware that men sit that way for a reason and it isn't because we have testicles? Well, that is some of it, but not really even the big reason.

Men tend to have much more narrow hips in comparison to women. So, when we sit down, it is easier for our legs to follow the angle of our hips. In trigonometry and engineering, it's called a Q line or Q angle. When a woman sits, generally, it will be more comfortable and natural to have her legs closer together. Again, it is because the femur bones are placed at a certain angle in what is called the acetabulum, the ball on the femur. How we sit, simply is the most comfortable line coming out of the hip socket. For women, generally this will keep the legs closer together.

It's hard to explain but I'll try. Imagine a horizontal line, that has a vertical line coming off the ends, point down. The longer or shorter that line on top is(the hip structure), will determine how the angle of the two vertical lines(the legs), is constructed. This will determine the limits of range of motion on the angle of your acetabulum leaving the hip socket.

This causes people with wide hips, generally women but not always, to be most comfortable with their legs closer together while they sit. People with more narrow hips, generally men but not always, to be most comfortable with their legs further apart while they sit.

Basically, asking a person with narrow hips to sit with their legs together, is mean. If you see anyone sitting with their legs spread, please don't shame them. This is actually a form of body shaming to make an individual sit that way. Then, to assume it is simply because they want to exert power, and not because they are anatomically built that way, is in my eyes rude. Not only is that making an assumption, it is also denying an individuals bodily autonomy. To shame someone privately or publicly about this is just strange to me. 

If you want to test this out. Find a friend with wide hips. Have them sit in one of those yellow plastic kids chairs that pushes their hips together pretty hard. You will notice that their legs, magically, start to spread open more. It is the exact same mechanism of action with hip size. And it isn't limited to one sex or gender either. It simply comes down to hip size. Men on average will have more narrow hips because we didn't evolve to bear children. Of course this is speaking in generalities, I'm simply talking about the averages. 



On top of what I've written. My other questions would be. Who determined manspreading to even be an issue? What data did they use to come to this conclusion? Why is it assumed that someone sitting this way is about power, and not simply anatomy of the human body? Did they go around asking people with their legs spread a bit too far if they were planning on world domination or spreading the patriarchy further? OK, that last one was a joke, but I hope you get what I'm saying here. I think even assuming manspreading to be considered a thing, is incredibly problematic in my eyes. It's completely gendered when it has to do with hip size, not power or someone having a set of balls. I'm not gonna say I've never smashed my balls together though either. Hell, I've sat on one of them before when it stuck to my leg one time and hurt like no other. That isn't the main reason, and it has more to do with hip size. 

I have about a decade of previous work in medicine. I think part of the problem comes down to this. If you ask a guy why he sits that way, he will say because he has balls and it's more comfortable. However, I don't believe the average individual without any medical training on anatomy, physiology, ortho, and even a little trigonometry, are actually aware of why it happens. Saying, because balls, is the answer someone who doesn't know how the anatomy of hips works. I had a bad hip injury, and worked in medicine. So, I studied the all hell out of how hips work in an attempt to live with less pain. I use that knowledge to modify certain activities, and really just have a better grasp on why I have pain in that area.

Here's to a civil discussion on this topic. I hope I have changed some minds already. But, as always, I'm open to other opinions, answers, and even anecdotes if you have them. Cheers!

37,"What does ""equality"" mean?","This is more of a philosophical question than a moral question or a feminist ""praxis"" question. 

The [IEP article on egalitarianism](https://www.iep.utm.edu/egalitar/) lists several different interpretations of equality. Some of these seem to have counterparts in feminism; for instance, most people when asked intuitively describe gender equality in terms of *social power relations*- ""equally empowering women"". 

There's also a more neoliberal-conservative strain of thought that defines gender equality as ""equal rights"" or ""equal opportunities"" alone.

And then there seems to be a more ""radical"" strain of thought that considers equality to be the total abolition of gender itself.

All of these definitions seem to lead to further complications. Power relations, for instance, are very slippery things, and can change based on the social contexts that define the scope of analysis. For instance, a society could plausibly exist where women can have authority over any strange men in the public sphere, but no authority over their single husband in the domestic sphere. Another society could exist where women inherit and control all private property through matrilineal right, but politics and war is purely the realm of men, and political dynamics are defined by a tense balance of power between the two spheres. Are these cultures ""feminist"" or not?

The liberal definitions also lead to issues: ""opportunity"" and ""outcome"" are never easily distinguished. Since the world is deterministic, all opportunities usually exist only as a result of previous outcomes. The result is that there is always an interminable and in-principle unresolvable debate within liberal discourse about whether AA or quotas or diversity programs count as ""equal opportunity"" or ""equal outcome"".

Equality as radical gender abolitionism is probably the most controversial at all: there is debate over whether it even makes sense to distinguish an ""autonomous self"" from ""cultural conditioning"", as well as debate as to whether gender abolition is even biologically/culturally possible for humans, and also over whether it is even desirable.

38,A question on social constructionism and transgenders.,"(I'm not trying to be transphobic or hateful in any way but this question has been bugging me for some time now)

There are plenty of feminist authors and scholars who seem to support the theory that gender is a social construct. How do they reconcile this with the existence of transgender people?

If gender is a social construct, how come transgenders identify themselves as something else than their sex? Shouldn't they have been socialized to conform to the stereotypes associated with their sex?

Maybe i'm looking at it all wrong and I was hoping if this subreddit could help me out.

48,What are we talking when we speak about consent? (Lots of questions inside),"Recently came across the following consent rule, which is called FRIES and stand for  
Freely Given  
Reversible  
Informed  
Enthusiastic  
Specific

(Source: Planned Parenthood)  
And i do have a doubt with the enthusiastic part. Don't get me wrong, i think all sex should follow the FRIES, however i understand enthusiasm as a form of communication and an explicit form of yes, BUT in the strictly legal sense, consent is just the acknowledgement of having sex and accepting it.

But let's take enthusiasm out of the equation (which i have no idea how to prove it in court TBH) and take for granted all of the others (if you need a mental picture, imagine a wife-husband relation bad sex). Everybody knows this is far from good, but i think is also far from rape.

Therefore, when we speak about consent in this subreddit, are we speaking in an strictly legal way or in a sex positive way? Sometimes i seem unable to make the distinction.

This distinction is pretty important in law, because if we acknowledge rape as lacking any point in point in the FRIES , then prostitution would be for the most part illegal (this is how the Swedish model of demand criminalization is argued BTW), for instance. Even oral sex could be acknowledged as rape.",AskFeminists,1537741274,heavenh3ll,19,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9icis2/what_are_we_talking_when_we_speak_about_consent/,2018-09-23

52,Why do you choose to blindly support trans identified men despite all they have in common with incels?,"Before reading this post you should know what incels and what being transgender is. Most people already have a warped view of the latter, but not everybody knows what incels are. From the inceltears sidebar, “incels are hateful involuntary celibates. Incels blame women, their genes, attractive men, and society at large for their inability to get dates or sex” You might wonder what that has to do with trans identified men.

They are driven by the same misogyny that takes them in different paths. Some of them embrace the misogyny and do what they can as a man. Sometimes whining, sometimes abusing, and sometimes committing mass shootings. Others choose to let their misogyny define them and invade women’s spaces while doing the same exact things. One is clearly more dangerous than the other and that’s the one group we choose to accept!

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/73Qo4ld) are a few examples of the correlation between the transgender and incel community. Notice that even though this post is focused primarily on TIMs, I provided examples of TIFs as well because some of them can be just as bad as TIMs are as a desperate attempt to be accepted in the manosphere! This is not all of the posts, just the first ones that showed up. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/i61a93m) are a few example posts of incels pushing others to transition. Again promoting the trans agenda, pushing others into irreversible surgeries!

Almost every single day, there’s a picture of what they believe to be an ugly man . Sometimes it’s their “saint” as a woman, sometimes it’s Elliot Rodgers. These men are brainwashing misogynists into transitioning just like how the transgender cult is brainwashing children into transitioning. The incel movement and the transgender movement have always been intertwined and few people have pointed it out. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/nwW01Me.png) is an example of somebody who made the connection before I did and she was downvoted, labelled a terf, silenced, and banned from Inceltears! The same subreddit I was banned in for expressing similar views.


TIMs and incels both have a false sense of entitlement. Just like incels believe that they are entitled to a woman’s body, TIMs feel entitlement to women’s spaces. The idea of state sponsored girlfriends is ridiculous and everyone is opposed to that besides for toxic manospherians. However, the idea that a man should be entitled to free cosmetic surgeries, access to spaces for women who need to feel safe from men? Endorsed by millions across the world. We as a society are not giving into these incels’ demands. But what are we giving to these transgender people who claim to be women? Free cosmetic surgeries. Access to women’s shelters, women’s prisons, who they will end up attacking! If your first reaction to the idea of an incel sharing your bathroom is disgust and fear, why should it not be the same for a trans identified man? 

Both TIMs and incels have an unhealthy obsession with anime. I hate to bring something that seems so trivial into this but it’s actually a really big issue. Asian countries are by far the most patriarchal, so it’s no surprise that they’re drawn to Japanese media, which is misogynistic and enforces negative gender stereotypes. On subreddits like the traaaaa one and sites like incels.me, the majority of these men sexualize cartoon characters created by perverted Japanese men. Characters that are often times underage!

I sympathize with those who have gender dysphoria, I really do! I’ve hated my own body, I’ve hated how I look my entire life. I’ve struggled with eating disorders, self harm, and other unhealthy coping mechanisms that weren’t healthy! Just like mutilating your genitals and taking hormones isn’t healthy! I don’t sympathize with the perverts who act out their sick fantasies and invade women’s spaces. And that’s what most trans people and incels are!

Incels and trans identified men also share the same issue in which they think sex or transitioning will solve their problems when in reality it won’t! They always whine about how they can’t get sex or hormones, jealous of those who are capable of doing so, and often times hating on them. Don’t pretend “cis hate” doesn’t exist.

In conclusion, trans identified men and incels are two sides of the same coin. There is little to no difference between them and there’s no reason to blindly support one’s perverted misogynistic behavior and criticize the other’s. Everyone should denounce the actions of TIMs as well instead of only the actions of incels. TIMs are worse than incels in the fact that they have access to women’s spaces, they have the capability to target vulnerable women that incels only dream of having. They have the means, they have the motives, and they’re closer than any incel will ever be! And that’s a valid reason for “transphobia”!

54,"""Slippery Slope"" is considered a conditional fallacy where one has to demonstrate that X will lead to Y. I struggle with some feminist arguments that lean on the slippery slope.","I consider myself a feminist. However, there are some arguments that I don't agree with. I think that most people would agree that you don't have to agree with every feminist argument to be a feminist. Certainly, I believe in concepts like privilege. And that we live in a patriarchal culture (although I prefer the concept of the Kyriarchy that includes socio-economic oppression as one of the dominate forms of oppression in our society)

The slippery slope argument is kind of seductive because it often sound reasonable.

As an unrelated example, lots of people think that violent video games lead to violence in real life. We often cite examples where mass shooters have been known to play violent video games, as if to suggest that it's a causal relationship. Ignoring the possibility that violent people are simply attracted to violent things and as such, video games are attractive to them (a correlative relationship). As such, it makes perfect sense that violent people play violent video games but but the reverse can't be automatically assumed that violent video game players are an indicator of violent people.  And there are even studies that demonstrate that giving a person a place to [""blow off steam"" can reduce incidence of violence](http://www.glitch.news/2018-03-15-scientific-study-violent-video-games-reduce-violence.html).

A implies B but B does not imply A. 

It seems like quite a few feminist arguments lean on the argument of a slippery slope fallacy. That lesser toxic masculine behaviours lead to greater violations of behaviour, like sexual assault. I think guys can often be assholes but I think they draw the line at assaulting women. There's certainly a lot of men who cross that line, I'm not denying their existence. but I don't necessarily believe that there's a causal relationship. Just a correlative one. I don't think we can assume that micro-aggressions lead to a culture of macro-aggressions. 

More over, it bothers me that we could actually be doing harm by focusing on these misleading concerns and not finding the source cause of macro-aggressions, sexual assault and violence.

59,Approaching a Woman in a Bar,"So here is the background for my question.  I was out with a friend, who noticed a woman he was attracted to, alone with a friend.  He asks me to help him try to talk to the two of them.  I am attached, so I have no sexual/romantic intent.  We talk to them a bit and they are engaging, but sarcastically so.  We return fire and engage in some light banter, discuss the usual surface level topics, they politely excuse themselves after 10 minutes and we bid adieu.  The woman I was speaking to happens to be moderately famous.  Not really knowing who she was at the time, I look her up out of curiosity in the ""its cool I randomly met X"" way and saw she promptly took to Twitter to mock our unsuccessful attempts to hit on her and disrupt her time with her friend.  


Additional background:  We were at all times polite, kept a table between us (no invasion of personal space), I at no time made any comment, compliment about either of their looks, no creepy staring or anything resembling a pick-up line.  That said, my random-stranger conversation game may be subpar as I am a hard introvert and I am no male model.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is two-fold - First, given the above, was it wrong from the feminist perspective to approach women at a bar?  And second, assuming if not, what if anything was wrong about my approach or what suggestions do you have?  


This is the type of thing I feel like I should just laugh off as a self-absorbed person taking mean-spirited shots on social media, but this one got to me a bit.  Made me feel honestly pretty shitty and will probably ring in the back of my mind if I am single again and want to approach a woman.  I'd honestly like to better understand the other perspective.

64,I have a question about rape culture.,"I will admit that I used to scoff at the idea of rape culture, and I would try to write it off by claiming that ""everyone knows rape is bad"". 

Everything that has happened in Hollywood and the entire MeToo movement as well opened my eyes to the fact that sexual assault and rape is far more widespread than I initially thought.

Today, a co-worker of mine was telling me that there are over 400,000 back-logged, untested rape kits in the United States alone with over five dozen jurisdictions that have entire warehouses of up to 10,000 untested rape kits. I was easily able to verify this for myself with a quick Google search. Apparently, this is due to a general lack of funding and resources? 

There aren't enough resources to test a rape kit, yet there is plenty of money to continue funding war on drugs and U.S. involvement in foreign affair?

65,My ignorance regarding transphobia?,"Can someone please read the thread at r/feminism I recently posted in and then was banned from the subreddit for. I realize I made some kind of mistake, but I'm at a loss as to what was transphobic in my post. The mods don't want to communicate with me. I'll try linking my comment. Bear with me. 

I've been a lifelong feminist and I'm not transphobic (intentionally), seriously, so I'm pretty upset over a ban from the main subreddit devoted to the one safehaven in my life. I welcome trans women into the feminist movement and they are women. I've never said otherwise nor do I think otherwise. 

I don't personally know any trans people and I obviously have much more to learn about how to use language and concepts in a non oppressive or exclusionary way. It's a process. Part of this process is understanding what caused my ban from that subreddit. 

I really despise divisions within the feminist movement (they break my heart) and I was mistakenly attempting to explain where I think terf opinions can stem from because I really hate the ostracism 'terfs' face and I'm convinced there is room for constructive dialogue and helping everyone understand each other better, to some degree. I think this is important in all progressive movements. I've come to this viewpoint because all I see is increased polarization between people and total lack of communication, which is dangerous. I also know how exhausting it is to deal with the same crap over and over. I don't agree with terfs, and I've heard about some of the abhorrent actions some of them have taken (lies, violence).

I also think sometimes radical feminist viewpoints can be blanket-equated with terf viewpoints by people who have never understood radical feminism and consequently trans inclusive radical feminists can be alienated from a movement that should be happy to have them. This doesn't encourage learning, reconsideration, understanding between people who probably haven't had a lot of prior contact. It might push some radical feminists to become trans-exclusive if radical feminist ideas are said to be  incompatible from the get go with trans inclusivity (which they are not - smarter people than me have delved into this deeply in the conversations project, for example). 

I likely should not have posted that particular response to that particular thread. It was the entirely wrong context and probably seems like a terf defense. I get that now. The only counter to that is I didn't realize how strict the discussion is (which is also stupid in hindsight).

Someone else who I thought did a very good job of posting was also banned, and it kind of seems to me that maybe we can't talk about the idea of gender as a construct anymore. That this is considered transphobic in itself in mainstream feminism and I'm only now getting the memo. 

As a bit of additional background - me, personally, nowadays if I was a kid people would probably think I was trans for my 'gender non conforming' presentation. So even though I think man and woman are essentially human-limiting, hierarchy-reinforcing constructs, ultimately, it's not like I think people have a choice in who they feel are. I grew up fighting against gender rules because how I inherently felt didn't match up with society's expectations. If someone is born and assigned one sex/gender and feels it doesn't fit them then who the f*ck am I to tell them otherwise? 

I'll try linking to my post with an edit but otherwise it's in my recent comment history.

Over a year ago I started reading radfem and ""TERF"" beliefs, and started to find myself agreeing with them. For this period of time I considered myself someone who agreed with these views. However, I keep having this nagging feeling that something is wrong and that I'm on the ""wrong side"", and I really want to fully understand the concepts and reasoning behind statements such as ""trans people are their chosen sex"". 

(Before I go any further I promise this is not a troll post or being asked in bad faith and I don't plan to link this anywhere because again I would really like to distance myself from GC feminism. Also if this is inappropriate for this sub I'm sorry but I want to know the feminist perspective specifically. CMV is kind of full of guys who are not familiar with any sort of feminism, not really the type of opinion I'm looking for. If you're reading this and think it might cause distress to you please do what's best for you because I don't want to hurt anyone)

I guess, questions?

1. Why are trans people their chosen gender? I guess it must be different for every person, but often with both trans men and trans women I see them say stuff like that they were always more masculine/feminine which is a ""sign"" or ""how they knew"", but how is that not sexist? Or is it one of those ""everyone is a little sexist"" things but that's ok because they're pursuing their best life? 
2. What is the difference between a woman and a man? (I know this is one of the ""TERF Gotchas"" but I really need an answer to this one that makes sense. I'm sorry.)
3. Why is using female to describe vaginas, vulvas, etc transphobic exactly? Is it because trans women are hormonally female because they take estrogen? And, is it always transphobic or only if you do it to exclude trans people? (EG difference between saying ""People with vaginas are female"" versus referring to ""my female parts"" or whatever)
4. Is there any value in having all-female (AFAB) spaces or conversations or are they inherently transphobic?
5. Do you guys believe masculinity and femininity (gender roles) are social constructs or are there parts of them that are innate?

If you guys have any other parting thoughts that you think might convince me please feel free to share them. Honestly arguing really stresses me out so I probably won't respond to every post or point, only ones I need further clarification on. I just want to be free of this way of thinking once and for all.

To any gender critical radfems reading, I understand maybe you want to reply to these but honestly those aren't really the perspectives I'm looking for right now, of course I don't think I can actually ban people from replying in this sub if they're feminist but I really want to explore different ideas and I hope you can respect that.

70,Question about emotional labor and opening up to friends,"So, I'm not 100% sure what exactly emotional labor is, but I think I have a rough idea. I'm aware that, whatever it is, women are expected to do much more of it than men. One dynamic that I've often heard of is that men are often able to be more open about their feelings with their female friends than they are with their male friends. Is that an example of unequal distribution of emotional labor?  

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I ask is that I kind of need someone to open up to. I'm a 31-year-old guy and I've been bottling up a lot of very painful things for many years. Not sexual abuse or anything but, well...a lot of painful things. I want to open up to someone about them. I already see two therapists and a psychiatrist, and I've been opening up about these things to them for years. They've been immensely helpful, of course. But that's not the same as opening up to a friend, I think.  

&amp;#x200B;

A friend knows me in ways a therapist doesn't. A friend sees me in my ""natural habitat"", whereas a therapist sees me for an hour in a controlled environment. A friend can give me feedback that a therapist can't. I have male friends as well as female friends but, as you probably guessed, I feel more comfortable about opening up to female friends. Now, it's not as if I use them as emotional tissues or anything. Most of my interactions with them are fairly light-hearted and fun. And I've had conversations with them in which we both open up to each other. I think it's safe to say that I'm close friends with these women (one of them even invited me to her wedding, and she's one of the first people I called when my grandfather passed away last year).  

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I should mention is that at least part of these  painful things I want to talk about have to do with dating and romantic/sexual relationships. Again, it's a lot to unpack, but those are painful and sensitive topics for me. I've spoken about them at length with my therapists and psychiatrist, but the reason I want to talk about them with my female friends is because they're, for lack of a better word, my ""target demographic"". Of course, I'm not interested in dating these particular women (who are all in relationships or married), but I think that they can give me feedback and insights that, for example, a straight man would not be able to.  

&amp;#x200B;

Still, my dating-related issues are just part of a much bigger interconnected web of issues. Obviously, I don't want to unload all of my issues on any one friend. But I haven't talked about them with a friend in many years, and these issues have kind of made my life grind to a halt. I'm hoping that a friend may be able to help me deal with them in ways that a therapist can't.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my main question is this: is it problematic of me to want to open up about these issues to my female friends? Is it wrong that I feel more comfortable talking to them about these issues than I do talking to my male friends about these issues? If I were to talk about these issues with my female friends, would I be unfairly burdening them with emotional labor? Should I, instead, open up to male friends about them?",AskFeminists,1537889156,3shar5ever,5,9,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9it363/question_about_emotional_labor_and_opening_up_to/,2018-09-25

91,Is slut shaming really a double standard?,"Slut shaming would be a double standard if men and women faced the same sexual dynamics environment, but they don’t, it is actually the polar opposite, so it kind of makes sense that society has different expectations for men and women. It is essentially to do the opposite of what comes easiest for each respective gender. Men and women face massively unequal opportunities for new sexual partners, it is probably the single most statistically significant gender disparity of any kind there is. So in the face of these two extremely different, essentially polar opposite sexual dynamics each respective gender faces, it seems obvious that societal expectations would also necessarily have to be opposite to hold this dynamic in place-which already operates in women’s favor. Slut shaming is actually- counter intuitively, what gives women their erotic capital. Assuming that men and women have naturally equal sex drives - and thar appears to be the case.

 So it isn’t really a double standard? Not really. I wouldn’t say it is right though-because no one should really mind what other people do with their genitals.

One double standard I have noticed is that I often see feminists shame men for having low N Counts or being virgins. N count shaming is N Count shaming. Isn’t the shame of being faced by male virgins worse than that faced by promiscuous women? What is worse being shamed for doing something you have the power to either do or not do? Or being shamed for a situation you would change if you could as in the case of most male virgins. Why is this a woman’s issue for feminists? It seems like men if anything get the worse end of N count shaming, and slut shaming, as much as I dislike it, seems to actually benefit women as a whole at the expense of a few women who had a great time anyways. 

The way I see it we should be more worried about N count shaming, the gender neutral term, because the worst sufferers aren’t actually sluts.

92,The Kavanaugh debacle - is the long-term effect of events like this even a thing?,"Hello everyone,

I know I am touching a very hot iron here, and not being American and thus not really involved in the bitter partisan war that currently seems to be going on, it may seem I am missing the point.

But I d like to ask a question or two about the current Kavanaugh case, and a feminist perspective.

First of all, I believe that all 3 (at the time of this posting at least) accusers are not lying, or part of some democratic strategy that was set in motion years ago. I also think Kavanaugh has been lying a few times during this affair (especially his virginity claim) as part of a strategy that was slow to adapt to the new accusations. And, frankly, in this particular case, because a lifelong judge on the supreme court needs to be a person of near-flawless character, he should never be confirmed.

HOWEVER:

Kavanaugh is a product of a time and a society. His behaviour, as pointed out by his accusers even, was within the limits of what seemed to be apparently ""normal"" behaviour for elitist male cliques at the time. I do not for one second believe that he was the sole pure angel in a band of rascals - any man can tell you, that is not how male peer groups work. If you dont drink, do drugs and sleep around in a clique that does so, you are not invited anymore. 

Also, anyone who has had contact with members of upper class male cliques knows that this is not surprising behaviour.

So, 30 years later we take somebody to court, at least court of public opinion, about something that was very much the normal behaviour in his time and place. Obviously, it wasnt ""good proper behaviour"" back then either, so there is some justification to this, but at the same time it wasnt punished, consequences werent drawn, for all intents and purposes it was ""okay"" to be a dick to, among others, women at your party. I detest that, you detest that, I get it.

But how many Kavanaughs are there? Young men who, often through peer pressure, crossed borders we now deem uncrossable? Hundreds, thousands probably. Obviously, few will ever seek a position as high as SC justice, but if they wanted to hold office, if they wanted to apply for a high-level managment job, do we really want this past to be a silver bullet for their aspirations?

For a SC justice, due to the nature of the position, I would agree that this speaks of poor character, and hopefully there are other, even conservative, candidates that have fewer skeletons in the closet of their past behaviour. And frankly, since Kavanaugh lied this week and last week and several times more recently, the case is closed either way, accusations or not. But I sincerely think the idea of judging a time decades ago by the modernized sensibilities of today is not a path we should follow for long, as it is unfair, its asking far too much foresight from young women and men during a time when they are ill-equipped to handle peer pressure and such, and it is liable to destroy many good peoples lives just because they dare to step into the spotlight of public attention.",AskFeminists,1538002351,KaijuKi,17,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9j7ewv/the_kavanaugh_debacle_is_the_longterm_effect_of/,2018-09-26

100,"Is there any evidence that the phrase ""Boys will be boys"" is used to ""excuse negative behavior"" from boys and men?","Sociology Professor Cliff Leek Makes the following statements in [this article](https://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-amid-kavanaugh-allegations-rethinking-the-common-refrain-boys-will-be-boys/):

***This national dialogue around this phrase ‘boys will be boys,’ and using that to excuse negative behavior from boys and young men, is certainly not something new.*** *But what I’ve always found interesting about it is that we never use that phrase ‘boys will be boys’ to discuss positive things that boys do.* ***It’s almost exclusively used to write off or explain away when boys misbehave****, so it’s actually reinforcing the idea that that sort of misbehavior, including serious offenses, are what we should expect from boys, and to even take it a step further, it almost frames it as if to imply that those behaviors are actually what make boys boys.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Where is the evidence for this?** Specifically, where is the evidence that the there is a societal trend that leads to misbehavior from boys or men being excused in any way, with or without the explanation that ""boys will be boys"". **By evidence I mean anything that isn't an anecdote or a case study.** The reason for this is basic scientific methodology - the claim concerns a large population (the nation of the USA) and any evidence in support of it must therefor be representative. 

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE**: You may notice that the clip in the article (if you listen to it) starts by quoting two people who allegedly brush off the allegations as ""boys will be boys"". However, by looking at the actual sources of those claims, it becomes clear that they are not referring to the allegations - but referring to what they believe happened.

101,What to do about Behavior done when younger,"Hello all,

I have been wrestling with this internal struggle of what to do about misbehavior I have done in my youth towards women. This struggle has even intensified as the hearings of Bret Kavanaugh have been going on and his past behavior coming to light. I have been intensely reflecting on behavior when I was a teenager and early college age. Maybe I should go a little more in depth about myself and the things I have done to give everyone a better perspective. I will be showing you all a side of me in my past that was the worst. It was not the whole of who I was. This is difficult for me to write but I can only imagine the women that have seen that side of me feeling far worse at the time

I am a 24 year old male (25 in 4 months) of middle eastern descent. I am the oldest of 6 and have 4 sisters and one brother. The transgression I have done and will continue into explaining were from the ages of 11/12-19/20. I was raised Muslim and taught to respect women, wait until marriage for sex and was not allowed to date by my parents rule. These stories will not reflect that. From a young age I knew I was very interested in girls. I really enjoyed speaking with my female classmates just as much if not more as my male ones. In elementary school I never took issue with girls playing sports or doing “boy” things and encouraged the girls to play with us. I don’t remember what happened but in middle school things started to change.

Middle School was a very amazing time for me, I look back on it with fond memories with exception of how I started to treat the females in my grade. My earliest memory and first inappropriate behavior was slapping and squeezing girls( I apologize if my terminology is not proper) butts. It was almost like a game for guys in our grade. Talking about whose butts we had squeezed or whose gf let them squeeze and slap their butts. I remember one girl I slapped her butt hard enough that it left a mark on her butt. Another time I think it was in the 7th or 8th grade a girl dumped water on me and I chased her with my water bottle, she slipped and fell and I dumped water on her while singing Akons slap that.  The final specific instance in middle school that I look back on is in a class in which we were watching a movie and a girl who showed interest in me was sitting next to me and I placed my hand on her lap and was groping her from over the pants. She would move my hand and I’d put it back on her lap and try again. This was in the 8th grade. I also used vulgar language speaking to and about women at this time. Not regularly more so uncommonly but it occurred and every once in a while I recall specific conversations or things said. At this time I used to play games like truth or dare and spin the bottle. The summer between middle school and high school was a turning point for me.

I had gotten caught shoplifting some cards with “friends” of mine from a meijer this summer. It was a dumb thing that cost me doing 50 hours of community service. I started to volunteer at my local mosque and became quite religious and devout. I hadn’t had any issues that I can remember that year of inappropriate behavior to women that year because of it. I didn’t date, or do anything remotely close to what I did in middle school. I must have wiser  up, started to mature but nothing jumps out at me that was bad except I still had a feeling that talking to women, getting with women and being able to make them like you was a game, I just considered myself “retired” and a coach to my friends. 

Everything I remember went well until maybe the end of my junior year/ start of senior year. I began driving and was able to take girls out on dates. I had started working and was a young manager at a skating rink and bouncy house party place for kids. I had started to lose faith in my religion and I began to sink back into talking to girls and I remember when I wasn’t talking with a girl I wanted to date, I was talking to them as if I wanted to date or have a relationship but really just wanted the sexual stuff. I did a lot of texting and ghosting. The end of my senior I was having relations with an older women who thought I was older than I was. I would even skip classes to keep the lie up. I had no intentions of a relationship but I don’t believe she did either. I bring this up because this is the first I remember of using lies to get with women. This will come into later when I began working at an amusement park. 

That summer before college I took a trip to Lebanon to visit family. I was there for 3 months. While there it was myself my grandparents and the maid.  One day I asked the maid if she wanted to perform Oral sex. She said sure and we had sexual relations throughout that summer. When I look back at this time, I don’t think it was something that she believed she could object to, and I couldn’t tell you if that 18 year old me knew that or not. I know I wasn’t intending to force her to do anything but I do still think to this day if she knew that refusing wouldn’t have had any repercussions.

When I got back and started university at Toledo, I joined a fraternity and I was intense about my studies. I had wanted to become a pharmacist. But I still had an eye for women. I was free from parents, had a place to be able to take women, and I remember it wasn’t very hard. My ugly side became disgusting at this time. I was having relations with one girl in particular that was a relationship where she was pursuing and I was only interested in the sex. I would ask her to meet up before classes, late night calls, and even in bathrooms between classes. I lied to her just to have sex. I had taken her to the basement of the fraternity, we had sex, and I then texted in the group chat of the frat guys, walk of shame in 5 minutes. I wish I could say that was the worst way I treated this woman. I believe the worst was when she asked me to show PDA( public display of affection) and I told her no, she asked again and I told her for oral sex I’d consider it. So we went to the basement bathroom of the University and she began until she stopped and said she didn’t want to anymore, i then asked if she wanted the pda or not. She continued, I want to remember that I showed some PDA afterwards. But I’m scared to say that is wishful thinking and the animal I was never did.  Again I want to remind you I’m showing you the worst of me and that these stories were not the whole of who I was. 

After a year at Toledo and being with different women there I came back home to change degrees to become a math teacher. I began using apps like tinder and okcupid. Online dating made it so easy for me to find women and still be able to study and not have to go out. There were many mutual one night stands, I began 2 true relationships as well. One of which I’ll refer to in a bit.  Probably the worst thing I did was go to an okcupid dates house, instead of going to the planned date, we stayed in, smoked marijuana, had sex, slept and when I woke up early in the morning I got dressed, left for class and she texted me “ok bye I guess” I responded I had class and i would text her later. I never did. 

One night I had decided to apply to work at an amusement park called Cedar Point. It seemed like a lot of fun and a job that would make for a fun summer. Tinder and okcupid was still in use and I was around college year people like myself and foreigners from different countries as well. The lying continued to get with women. I was even pretending to be foreign to make myself more “exotic” I would speak with an accent which wasn’t difficult to get away with because I could speak Spanish, French and Arabic. I had many hookups, and many ghostings I did. 

The worst was the relationship I had told you about earlier. We had started getting serious and hadn’t had sex yet which I didn’t mind because I really enjoyed her. When I was talking to a girl or trying to start a relationship I didn’t fool around with other women. The monster side went away. But one time this girl had invited me to stay over at a house she was sitting for. It was a lot of fun and I remember she had told me that a friend of hers had said not to sleep with an Arab guy because once you do they are gone. I hadn’t planned on doing that. We had sex, I returned to cedar point and I never spoke to that girl again. I still fight over whether to send her a message to apologize or not. This is one I think about probably the most because I really liked her. I couldn’t tell you why I did what I did.  The summer continued and I was having relations with a new girl a week, sometimes more.

One of these girls I had over at my place and as we started to have sex I realized she had started bleeding. I must have said something along the lines of “what fuck?” And she ran off embarrassed, I never stopped her or reassured her that it was ok. I let her leave and never saw her again. Then the end of the summer happened.

I met a Spanish girl towards the end of the summer. We started to talk and start a relationship. It was supposed to be a summer fling and we both knew it m. She would go to Germany at the end of the month and I would go back to school. We ended up doing the long distance thing and this last April I married her and August was our 4 year anniversary. Since I have been with her nothing has happened negatively and I can’t say I have done anything disrespectful or inappropriate to a women. But I carry a lot of regret for my actions from when I was younger. Looking back 5 years I can’t believe the way I was and the further back i go the more appalled I am about my thinking and actions. 

So why have I written this huge post? Well as I said I have been doing a lot of reflecting and I want to know what can I do? I don’t know where to go from here. My behavior was unacceptable, my thinking was disrespectful and I want to know how to go further. I don’t want to be in the future trying to defend what I did or explain why didn’t try to rectify my wrongs in the past. What do you as feminists believe I should do to make things right? I don’t know how but I’d like to make efforts in doing so.

This was very difficult for me to write. To show my sincerity I have used my main account on Reddit. I ask that you remember I am opening up things that many people don’t know about me and showing the worst of who I was. I am doing this to further myself as a person along with making sure the I move forward the right way in helping those I have wronged. I appreciate your time reading and responding. I apologize for the long post and I hope none of it was disrespectful or distasteful in the language I used.

103,MGTOW and feminism,"Hopefully this is a more inviting place for what I'm looking for (education dammit), and won't shun me for asking this. Feel like I must've hit some kind of taboo elsewhere. 

Anyway, can I please get a feminist point of view on the MGTOW...thing? I don't even know if I should call it a movement, or a group, or what. The very little I know, is that they appear to be incels (a term I could probably go on an hour rant on the logic of) who instead of admitting to themselves that they are the common factor in why they can't connect with a woman, have decided that they're ""big strong manly men"" who are by choice not going to even try anymore. I can't even tell if these men have sexual drive or not. It almost seems like a celibacy movement for men, but it also seems like if I looked into their websites more, I'd start finding the posts about how they are owed sex on a genetic level. Which as a scientifically inclined person, I...just can't even tell you how much a life form isn't owed reproduction. At least from my point of view. 

Soooooo yeah! I feel like I'm about to be hit with a whole lot of stupid (not you all, the things you're going to describe), so let me sit down and strap in for this. MGTOW. Wassat?

116,How do you overcome the uneven burden of political discourse?,"This isn't only a problem with feminism but it seems to be a hurdle that has to be cleared for any complex political or sociological discussion. We live in a world of sound bytes where trivially simplistic and misleading arguments frequently triumph over thoughtful, educated positions. This tends to lead to the adoption of simple phrases meant to compete in this arena that don't quite do the job.

I'll give you an example unrelated to feminism. I agree that racism is prejudice + power but that phrase is far too simplistic to unpack the nuance involved. You could quite literally spend your life studying the various intricate ways in which these dynamics play out throughout the world and still be left with more to grasp. So when someone hears this phrase they have the potential to take from it some unfortunate misconceptions and then use those misconceptions to straw man the original position.

It appears to me this is happening daily to feminism. I've heard more misguided screeds on Patriarchy than I care to revisit and concepts like privilege rub up against a social fragility so entrenched that simply discussing its existence can potentially enrage people.

So in order to have a discussion, in public or private, the feminist seems to have the burden of unpacking and summarizing hours of material in minutes while their opposition needs to merely balk and posture. They can completely sidestep modern sociology with a diatribe about individualism that's short and punchy. It seems to me the deck is always stacked against the more scientific position in any political debate. Their position is better supported but requires more of the listener to grasp than the good vibe down-home country charm of blatant pseudoscience or traditionalist hucksterism.

So what is your strategy to win hearts and minds and propagate healthy understanding of feminism? How do you overcome this burden and communicate your message effectively?

This is not the reason I listen to gangster rap, but I definitely acknowledge it is a very common theme within it.

I disagree with this statement - I do believe that some fraction of rapes happen not because of malice or desire for power, but because of emotionally unintelligent people being stupid and horny and impulsive. 

I also think that the statement that ""rape is about power, not sex"" does not reconcile well with another fairly common feminist idea - the idea that we need to educate people better about sexual consent. If rape is about power, then that means ignorance about consent isn't the problem; people who commit rapes know that they don't have consent, and they don't care.

135,I’m not sure where to post this but you all seem like a good place to start...,"Watching the Kavanaugh happenings this week, I have been reliving my own experience with sexual assault. If you can call it that? The lines are blurred and my best friend at the time did nothing besides ostracise me for speaking out. I unfortunately don’t know where to put this experience anymore, emotionally. 

When I was 16, I was almost raped by my boyfriend of 3 years. He had picked me up from work around noon, after he had gone to an all nighter event (my parents didn’t let me attend) where he had been doing ecstasy. We went back to his house, and he proceeded push the issue of having sex and I wasn’t feeling it (this often happened. he had a ridiculous, constant need to have all of the sex, all of the time) I said no, I had just gotten off work, it was midday and his family was home. But he didn’t stop. in spite of my crying he pushed me down, laid on top of me, and tried to remove my clothes. Luckily his friend rang the doorbell and he got up, and actually said that it was my fault that he didn’t get sex. At the time I could not believe it had gone that far, and I am confident that he would have carried on with the act had someone not come to the house.

I mentioned this incident to a couple of close friends, as we were speaking about drug use within our friend group and how it had impacted things. At the time, I thought my friends were supportive and believed me. I had no reason to lie about this, and wasn’t engaging in any sort of “smear campaign” as we had dated for a bit after this incident occurred (I was young, and clearly didn’t think much of myself at the time to continue this sort of toxic relationship)

I found out a year or so later that my best friend at the time ended up going back to my then ex boyfriend to tell him that I was spreading rumours that he had raped me. I was rather emotionally confronted by my ex, who had no recollection of the incident whatsoever and basically called me a liar. I found out my best friend had also told all of the lads in our group. She had never discussed this with me personally, barring that one initial conversation where I mentioned in passing what had happened. 

Anyways, I don’t think anyone has ever believed me because “boyfriends don’t do that” or “I just want attention” and “if it was so bad, why did you date him after that?!” I’ll admit that most of these feelings are my own, as I’ve never quite accepted that someone I loved could do that. And, more importantly, that I would debase myself by continuing that relationship. This single incident was a symptom of a greater sexual dysfunction in our relationship, the never ending (and I mean constant) badgering for sex really impacted me and continues to do so to this day.

Anyways sorry for the long post, I hope this is a good forum to put this stuff out there. I was really hurt that another woman could disrespect me in such a way, rather than have my back and support me as I would have done for her.

Since this whole Kavanaugh thing has been going on, I've been having trouble sleeping. Honestly, the whole thing makes me physically sick - knowing that victims of sexual assault will be poked and prodded for any holes in their testimony and treated like dirt.

I feel terrible for the women that are abused (Usually at the hands of men) and are scrutinized when they speak up about this abuse (Once again, usually scrutinized by men).

I've never done anything like this, but I can't help but feel guilty by being associated with a group of people that commit violence on such a scale, and then handwave any accusations. I mean, patriarchy, rape culture, all of these are the result of men, right? Sometimes I just feel like women would be better off without men in the world. None of these problems would be existent without men, and women would be able to live in a world where they don't have to worry about being harassed, or assaulted, or not taken seriously.

151,Awkward issue.,"I'm a hetero male, over 35.  This is an extremely awkward and difficult post to explain.  What I want to make absolutely crystal clear is that (in general) I strongly support Feminism, although the conduct and demeanour of lots of people I've seen discussing gender issues leaves a lot to be desired - people of all genders.

My query is regarding the issue of consent.  To be absolutely clear, this is not some attempt to *bait* women/Feminists in any way, nor is it some attempt to condone any form of coercion/disrespect/abuse, or to somehow justify the disrespect/rape/abuse of women.  When people say *'no means no,'* I am one of the most staunch and vocal advocates supporting this view.  And anyone that attempts to justify any form of coercion/disrespect/rape/abuse (most often men against women)...I am absolutely disgusted and sickened.

But does a lack of any formal discussion beforehand constitute a lack of consent?  i.e. the woman has not said *'no',* but they have not formally agreed to anything either.  Their body language, demeaour, and actions make it clearly obvious they wish to be intimate, but as mentioned, they have not formally agreed (or disagreed) to anything.

So while 'no means no' (there is no debating that)...but does a *lack of any formal discussion* constitute a lack of consent?  And it's this lack of any formal discussion that is the core issue.

154,Concern about my past behavior,"I'm a man, and I'm hoping this post is appropriate. Apologies in advance if it isn't.   


20 years ago, when I was in college, I behaved horribly toward women (I believe I would owe apologies to 5 women in total). To be clear, I never had nonconsensual sex, and I never touched a woman's private areas without consent. But, I was handsy when I should not have been, once, when I was drunk, with a woman who just happened to be sitting on the same bed with me at a dorm get-together. There are other examples, some worse, but the details may not be welcome here. I eventually apologized to one of the women (my behavior towards her in one instance was probably the most offensive of all the examples I could give), and she graciously forgave me. We remained in email contact for several years after (we were living in different places by then.) She even found me later on facebook and sent a friend request.   


I feel extremely horrible about my past perceptions towards women, and my own behavior. I had a totally messed up understanding of consent (as did many guys, especially 20 years ago and prior). I confused ""assault"" and ""harassment"" for being confident and edgy. But I see now that my behavior was assault, and I'm extremely remorseful. I wish I could apologize to the others, but I have no way of doing so, and I don't know if it would be welcome.

177,I have no idea how to handle the mistake I made; what should I do?,"I was talking to a girl whose cleavage was a bit exposed (and I am NOT criticizing her or her right to dress like this) and as we were speaking, my eyes sort of drifted down to the area between her neck and her breasts, for maybe a bit longer then they should have.

As we were taking, she covered her shirt up a little, then my eyes immediately moved back up to her eyes and stayed there. She didn’t explicitly say anything (of course, this could’ve been because it wouldn’t have been worth her trouble), we continued to talk afterwards, and she didn’t appear hostile, but I couldn’t help but feel that I might’ve made her uncomfortable. I genuinely feel terrible and contrite about what I did.

I initially considered what I did to be a disrespectful and embarrassing faux pas, and something from which I should learn to refrain from such behavior in the future. Yet for whatever reason I began to dwell uncontrollably on what I did, and with each instance of contemplation my perception of my action worsened.

I should preface by explaining that in the past I've had tics that compel me to do things I otherwise shouldn't do. One such example consists of looking at my feet a total of four glances while I'm driving, precisely because I know I'm not supposed to. Similarly, when swimming underwater, I feel compelled often to open my mouth and let water in four times, as I know that it would be best not to do so. These tics may seem trivial, but they have been natural for me for a long time.

Such tics have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I say this not to convey that these tics have made my life unbearable—they have not; rather, my purpose is to explain that these tics have become normalized for me. I’ve always suspected there may be an attention deficit component to these tics.

When I was young, I developed a similar tic-like habit whereby I would look at private parts. This eventually developed into something where I knew I wasn’t supposed to do something, but precisely because of this I felt compelled to do it anyway. I don't know why this tic in general developed. Was it due to the frequent thoughts about sex I had when I was 6/7? Was it due to innocuous portrayals of such behavior in movies/TV? I’d feel the need to steal glances at a private area a total of four times, in general. This urge has been there not just with women’s décolletage, but also with mens’ crotches at times, or women’s legs. This is especially true when I’m engaged in conversation with someone. This urge-driven tic wouldn’t necessarily always be there in every single interaction, but through some interactions it would be there.

It’s not that I deliberately try to leer or to make people uncomfortable. I don't openly stare, for instance, at a woman's chest for 10 seconds with wide eyes while drooling. I've never made comments, or touched, or tried to take up someone's personal space. I’m not trying to prey on people, or to try to impose myself on them sexually. For whatever reason, it's like when talking to a woman for extended time, it's hard for me to keep still in general. My eyes wander haphazardly, and combined with this tic, this happens.

And yet my reasons should not matter as much as the effects of what I did to her. She covered her shirt, and odds are good I made her feel uncomfortable. In the moment, I ascribed what happened here to my tic, and judged that I had been rude and disrespectful at worst, and that if I learned from this, I could move on. But over time, my dwelling in this became far worse. She'd continued talking to me during that conversation, and she wasn't hostile, true. But what was she not showing me? How can I be sure exactly how bad I made her feel? Maybe I ruined her day. Maybe I ruined her whole week. Maybe I made her feel less of herself. Maybe I've affected her life immutably. Are these exaggerations? Am I obsessing over this to an unreasonable degree, or are these possible, reasonable ramifications of what I did?

Furthermore, I began to fear that maybe, whilst I'd believed that I was never openly leering/ogling at people, what if I'd been wrong ever since I'd developed this tic? How many countless women could I have potentially made uncomfortable? No one has ever prior indicated that my presence made them uncomfortable. I've never been reported for anything even remotely minor. And yet I feel I can't be sure. I remember now just one other instance, from when I was younger, when a girl at school covered her shirt while I was talking to her. This is the only other time covering shirt had occurred. Was this due to my tic too?

As I read stories of people like Morgan Freeman, Bill O'Rielly and their workplace sexual transgressions, I see small, maybe if only tangential, similarities between what they did and what I did. Men like this have commented in women's figures in the workplace, touched their skirts, asked them how they 'feel about sexual harassment.' These transgressions seem to me patently wrong and inexcusable. And yet another thing they've been accused of is leering women up and down. Coupled with their other systematic patterns of behavior, it seems as though this leering should be construed as further attempts to make women uncomfortable in the workplace. And although I've never been party to these other types of behavior, I can't help but feel peripherally associate with these men.

Ultimately, I cannot ascertain for certain to what extent my actions in this instance stemmed from normalized tics, and to what extent it arose from subconscious irreverence for her person. I have little doubt that what I did stamp largely from a dependence on my normalized tics. Yet if I submitted to this tic, is this not the same as being irreverent to her person? Maybe I am no better than a Morgan Freeman/Bill O'Rielly. 

I've been hoping that the fact that she may not have even noticed, or likely forgot about what happened soon thereafter, may mean that I should get to move on if I promise to do better. But why not take this logic to completion? If a man rapes a woman, and she was too drunk or incapacitated to remember it, does this make him any less of a rapist? By the same logic, would her forgetting this make me any less of a harasser? Of a predator? I understand that to conflate rape with looking at cleavage would be disingenuous at best and malicious at worst—that's not my purpose. My purpose is to test this line of logic.

I cannot live with myself thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. This label has been weighing on me for months at this point. I can't eat properly, and can't get assignments done, I'm hardly sleeping. Sound funny, or facetious? I'm being genuine. I am deeply sorry for what I did, and I understand now not only that what I did was wrong, but also why it was wrong. I am cognizant now of how differently women can perceive objectification, and that, even if my tics become difficult to resist, this is no excuse at all for disrespecting someone else's person. But I can't go on thinking of myself as a sexual harasser. I just can't.

There are only two ways in which I could deviate from this course of action, either by rationalizing my actions or by and living with myself that way, or by accepting what I did, which would—even if only slightly peripherally—place me in a category of individuals with whom I am unequivocally unwilling to be associated. To commit to the former path would be to lead my life with unconscionable dishonesty; the latter, to undergo such a radical change in self-perception for which I have not the strength.

It feels odd that committing personally to taking my life seems to lift an enormous burden from my shoulders. I gain a sense of peace and clarity I've long not felt.

There is no impartial mediator to help me guide my thoughts. I had one feminist friend who told me that I'm overreacting. Yet I'm confident that there would be other people who would say I'm not overreacting. But if one person thinks I'm a sexual harasser, there must be legitimacy to that, yes? If I'm even .5% associated with a group of people including Freeman, O'Rielly, Ansari, etc. I can't live right myself.

I have virtually no concern with being potentially reported for sexual harassment. This isn't about that. It's about how I see myself.

181,Advice needed,"I submitted a post previously that I had to remove, but I got some really helpful comments.

I was hoping to get some constructive feedback from people reading this, particularly women.  As I've mentioned before, I am not looking to berate or degrade Feminism in any way, nor trying to justify any abuse/disrespect/violence against women.  Not in the least.  Nor do I accept coercion in *any* way.  I have no tolerance for any of this.

In one situation I experienced many years ago, I met a woman at a busy nightclub and was chatting to her.  Dark lighting, flashing nightclub lighting, (very) loud music.  Generally very difficult to see each other clearly and get a good 'read' of each other.  This woman agreed to come home with me, and once we got home together, it was obvious to me she was quite *'strange'*.  The next day I realised she must have been drunk, high on something, or probably both.  She wasn't drunk/high to the point where she was slurring, couldn't walk, about to be sick, etc.  Nothing like that.  But clearly her behaviour was *'off'*.  But it was only when we got in private that I could notice it.

We eventually went to the bedroom where her behaviour became even more strange as we started getting undressed.  I was just getting the impression that she didn't want to be there.  Or at least didn't want to have sex...at least not with me.  She didn't specifically say ""yes"" or ""no"" to having sex, but was just acting really, really weird.  We didn't end up actually doing anything together, but I just felt really uneasy, got up, put my clothes on, then suggested to her that I think she needed to leave.  I wasn't rude or abusive, but I did make it clear that she needed to leave.  And that's when things became really unpleasant.  She didn't yell or shout, but she did start raising her voice, telling me words to the effect that I couldn't tell her what to do and she wasn't going anywhere.  But the main issue with all of this was her tone and demeanour....just so strange and weird.  So hard to describe.

The situation reached the stage where I told her that if she didn't leave, I was going to call the Police.  Then she stopped what she was saying, started staring around strangely, where eventually she did leave.  But like I kept saying above, her behaviour was just so weird and bizarre.

With this situation, there was nothing that happened in bed, no coercion, no violence, nothing physical.  But it was an extremely unpleasant and difficult situation to be in.  As a guy, I know the overhelming majority of clashes and disagreements in the bedroom are the result of some wrongdoing by men.  Always?  No.  But in the vast majority of cases.  But these rare situations where women are behaving really strangely, what can men do to deal with this sort of thing?  Not just at the bedroom phase....but before even getting somewhere in private?  If they don't want to go to bed with a man, that is absolutely their right.  But why would they go home with a person late at night after being at a nightclub drinking, and then not expect there to be some sort of problems or issues arise?  They absolutely have the right not to go along, not to do anything in the bedroom - there is no question about that.  But why go home with the person to begin with?  And then refuse to leave the person's home?

These sorts of situations where women behave in the way are extremely rare, in perentage terms, and anyone that says otherwise I would strongly disagree with.  It is almost always men that cause most problems.

But as I'm sure you can appreciate it, it's extremely unnerving and frightening for men to be faced with these situations, even though these cases are rare.  I would greatly appreciate any advice.  And in particular, what can be said/done *before* getting into any 'in private' situations of any sort?

The vast majority of partners I've had have been totally fine, but there have been a few really bad situations (thankfully rare), and not just this one above.

That  being said, I've recently encountered someone online who claims that  when they were a child they were targeted and beat up more than once by a  'gang of black people'. Now assuming they didn't just make this up for  internet points (which they may well have) it does seem disrespectful  and futile to argue with them that their experiences of being targeted  based on race can not be called 'racism', so I didn't do that. What is a  respectful way to frame a white victim of crime's experience where they  may have been targeted due to their race, aside from 'racism against  white people'?

193,On not calling yourself feminist and Emer O'Toole's flowchart,"So there's been a couple of threads about whether or not it's fine to not identify as a feminist. Pretty recurring theme. And also there is a difference whether one wishes to avoid feminist label as a result of the usual commonplace prejudices or because WOC prefer to call themselves womanists.

But what really interests me is Emer O'Toole and her feminist flowchart. For O'Toole it's not enough that people who believe in gender equality present themselves as feminists. You are also required to believe that it's women that suffer the most and your advocacy has to be about women. If you accept that women are oppressed but still want to focus on the issues affecting men, then it's fine, but that isn't feminist. It might be from the place sympathetic to feminism but O'Toole is questioning if it's even worth calling oneself a feminist if one is concerned about the patriarchy hurting men too.

198,The Role of Societal Context in Morality,"Hi, all! This is my first Reddit post ever, so bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been lurking on this subreddit for a little while now out of interest. A few topics which get a lot of questions here (e.g., ironic misandry) are often addressed by bringing up idea of ""societal context"" with regards to the action. For example, gender-based discrimination against a cis man by a cis woman wouldn't be as problematic as the reverse because the cis woman's discrimination doesn't have systematic oppresion behind it. Basically, it's like the idea of ""punching up"" versus ""punching down"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm actually okay with this logic! It does, however, carry an assumption - that the morality of an action is judged not just by the inherent moral ""wrongness"" of the action itself, but also by the nature of the target that the action is performed against. And it is in this assumption that my question lies:

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, how much do you think that the factor of target nature, diminishes the moral wrongness of a given action?

&amp;#x200B;

Applied to the example above, how much less wrong would you consider gender-based discrimination by a cis woman against a cis man compared to the reverse? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not necessarily looking for numbers here, just a general idea. I've seen quite a few discussions where the idea of societal context was brought up; but I've never seen an explicit discussion that discusses the question I asked here, so I wanted to see what you all had to say about it.

I saw a post about “man-spreading” on the subway. Kept scrolling then saw a post (which is now on the front page) about a Saudi woman who was by law unable to marry the man she wanted. 

I thought *Wow, why are we so outraged about a guy spreading is legs on a subway when stuff like this is happening?* 

I understand it’s much deeper than that and I did feel bad. 

It’s kinda like.... 

“I’m hungry” 

“Well there are children in Africa starving to death” 

“Ok, well I’m still hungry.” 

If that makes sense?

225,Is tipping for service with a compliment appropriate?,"So today I went to pay for an overdue service at 9:00 PM (very late) I had been running through the city for hours trying to find somewhere to pay this bill, and the only business that was available at this hour was a small shop tended to by two elderly people, one man and one woman.  


The lady initially told me that they were closed, then the man asked me what I needed, I explained him my situation, I was still catching my breath from actual running.  I asked if he could help me pay my bill, he directed me to the lady again. After the lady was finished with the other customer, she asked me what I needed to pay, after seeing that it was important, she agreed reluctantly to help me.  


The lady that took my order was very old, but she was surprisingly sharp, she even handled money math better than me, this was either due money counting being her most polished skill or by my milennial aversion to cash operations.  

Since I wanted to express gratitude and reward her behaviour, I figured I would offer her a tip. When I saw that she was struggling to find small notes, I told her to keep the change. She wasn't interested.  


At that point I had already noticed that she was wearing really cute hairthingymajiggies, it isn't often that people this old still try as hard as young women to look pretty, she must have looked very pretty when she was younger.  So I figured that she would appreciate a compliment even more deeply than if she had accepted the money, so it seemed logical to offer something of more value to her than what I was already willing to offer, at no cost.

231,Dear speculative (1)feminists: what will the female future be like to live in?,"  A *huge* topic I know... but it needs asking.  It needs envisioning.  The 100-year-old sketch needs to be fully rendered into surround-sound 4D. The Women's Equality Party (WEP) in the UK has 7 objectives they've set as areas they'd like to see changes in policy (2).  We need to make this come alive in our imaginations.  
  So much of the debate right now is centred on how feminism will take away from white supremacist patriarchy, how BAME &amp; LGBT+ will split the fight for women's equality. Ste\\/e B@nn0n has stated that women are going to 'take charge of society' and has billed it 'patriarchy vs. matriarchy'. (3)  (I'm not sure what globalised, funded, power-mongering 'matriarchy' he refers to??? There isn't one I know of, and if there is, where do I sign up? ;) )   
   The answer so far: we will not need to point it out. People will be chosen for talent, skill &amp; experience, not gender and it will be unremarkable. Great! - however the path to this lovely existence requires a massive dismantling of entrenched social, political and economic systems that currently work to maintain the white male status quo.  What will the new systems be like to live in?

233,Parent teacher conference - sexist dress code (advice needed ASAP please!),"I’m going to my six grade daughter‘s parent teacher conference in an hour. At orientation (before school started), my daughter’s female teacher briefly discussed student dress code. The only thing that was actually addressed was “appropriate” wear for girls. Absolutely nothing was discussed regarding appropriate wear for boys. Her teacher said that girls need to be very aware of not dressing skimpy (to paraphrase), because boys are getting to the age where they can have “embarrassing physical reactions”. (Which I can only assume she means getting erections.) I was appalled. 

The parent teacher conference will be between her two main teachers, a male teacher and the female teacher who said these things at orientation. How can I discuss this with her teachers without coming off as confrontational or aggressive? The main points I would like to make are: (1) The boys could take preventative steps to avoid having embarrassing physical reactions (ie: wear pants with structured fabric). (2) Girls should not be basing what they wear off of what boys think/feel. (3) It is disturbing to me that this sends a message to the girls that what they wear is being prioritized over their education if they are removed from class for violating this part of the dress code.

234,Open Letter to the Mainstream Society Filth in Australia.,"To the Mainstream Society Filth in Australia.

&amp;#x200B;

In relation to a suggestion from a television show in the Australian mainstream media to ""offer tips for future stories"", the Australian mainstream media should do a story on the phenomenally high level of rank cowardice of the abusively deceitful gutless cowards of mainstream society in Australia as they, on a very large scale look for opportunities to climb over each other by means of deceitful politicking to advance their personal safety in the mob by spewing disingenuous misleading falsehoods out of their foul mouths and by actively and tacitly supporting abusive toxic deceit, in their promulgating a misleading false narrative of violence against women whilst spinelessly saying virtually nothing about the much greater prevalence of violence against men.

Violence within, and amongst, human societies is promoted by, facilitated by, encouraged by, enabled by, supported by and brought about by agency of deceit and general societal politicking more so than by the particular method used to implement the violence, is enabled and put into effect by means of the collaboration and power of various networks of both women and men, and society as a whole, to an incomparably greater extent than by the power of particular individuals, and is clearly, in accordance with the proportions of violence that have been inflicted on the respective sexes in pretty much every animal species since life first began to evolve on earth, inflicted not predominantly on women, but is very clearly inflicted predominantly on men, though for the human species to, in its corrupt condition of extensive false pretences, maintain such a condition of violence being inflicted predominantly on men in accordance with the proportions of violence that are inflicted on the respective sexes in the other animal species, the human species, unavoidably and necessarily, must continue to repeatedly fraudulently, falsely pretend need for violence being inflicted on men, and continue to heinously minimise or discount attribution of culpability to instances of violence that have been inflicted on men (whilst women typically control around 75-85 percent of all consumer spending in advanced economies such as Australia). The Ponzi scheme-like convolution of abusively deceitful, spinelessly self-serving, gutless contemptible curs in Australia and in other countries around the world competing to distract attention away from such facts concerning violence in society, as they inflict abuse upon men, are largely just competing for status in the pack and for optimum possibilities of safety from being targeted as objects of the cowardly abusive deceit of their own cowardly kind in the mob, which continues to deceitfully, duplicitously generate violence on a large scale and inflict cowardly violence and abuse on a large-scale predominantly on men rather than on women in the abomination of violence in society, which is directed so disproportionately against men.

A figure cited in June 2018 on an Australian television program, The Project, as 31 women killed in Australia, 3 of them not by males, in around five and a half months in a country of over 20 million people, used to push the standard misleading false narrative in society of violence against women, seems particularly low when compared to figures on deaths in Australia from a broad selection of other causes, for example, work-related incidents, traffic collisions, etc., and seems most remarkably low when compared to figures on cowardly violence and abuse inflicted not on women, but on men in Australia, cowardly violence and abuse with effects including around 6 men every day in Australia dying of suicide, an insanity that might be well described in general terms as 6 men a day having in the overwhelming majority of cases been painfully and very slowly, spinelessly, comprehensively abused to death by the deceitful gutless mainstream society filth in Australia, which typically spinelessly self-servingly seek opportunities to use the subhumanly, solipsistic, incessant, abusive heinous deceit of the subhumanly selfish, very abusively deceitful, contemptible cur, foul women of Australia to shamelessly further their own safety and status in the pack. 

The abovementioned abusively deceitful, spinelessly self-serving, gutless contemptible curs in Australia, including the subhumanly selfish, very abusively deceitful, contemptible cur, foul women of Australia, have, when persons have called them out concerning their part in the abuses inflicted on men, shown themselves to have remained hiding like the most contemptible cowardly curs from the principles and processes of justice and right conduct that they themselves make such high profile pretence to. The examples of trivialities and nonevents concerning actions by men, and other preposterous excuses, that have been constantly spinelessly excreted by said abusively deceitful, spinelessly self-serving, gutless contemptible curs in Australia, including the subhumanly selfish, very abusively deceitful, contemptible cur, foul women of Australia, for vilifying men and inflicting on men horrifically dehumanising cowardly violence and abuse are easily identified as trivialities, nonevents and other preposterous excuses when one considers using like examples of trivialities and nonevents when having been performed by women and children, and like examples of other absurd excuses, as excuses to correspondingly vilify women and children and attempt to excuse horrifically dehumanising cowardly violence and abuse inflicted on women and children. 

The illogic said abusively deceitful, spinelessly self-serving, gutless contemptible curs in Australia, including the subhumanly selfish, very abusively deceitful, contemptible cur, foul women of Australia, use is not complicated, it’s just the extortionist, standover merchant style of menacing, cowardly, fraudulent intellectual bluff, bluster and intimidatory standover tactics they use which keeps people too frightened to say anything about their constant diversion of attention away from the cowardice and culpability of the countless instances of the very large-scale, mob-dynamic cowardly violence and abuse they have inflicted on men, including extensive abominable heinous sexual abuse by means of sexual gossip, surreptitious surveillance and wrongful dissemination of private sexual information about men, in their incessant absurd attempts to divert attention away from countless previous instances of the very large-scale, mob-dynamic cowardly violence and abuse they have inflicted on men, with absurdities that are exactly 100 percent most conspicuously shockingly, extraordinarily, absurdly and atrociously lacking for pretences they have made of rationalising or in some way excusing their sinister heinous actions. They would not dare use such abusively absurd illogic to support occurrence of horrifically dehumanising cowardly violence and abuse being inflicted on women and children as they do for purposes of supporting occurrence of horrifically dehumanising cowardly violence and abuse being inflicted on men, frequently with abusively absurd illogic, to illustrate using a parallel example with the sexes reversed, in relation to the abovementioned extensive abominable heinous sexual abuse inflicted on men, along the lines of, “see how that woman pinched me on the buttocks last week, that’s the reason I’ve been raping her in numerous and frequent, repeated instances and on numerous and frequent, repeated occasions for the last 20 years.” 

Said abusively deceitful, spinelessly self-serving, gutless contemptible curs in Australia, including the subhumanly selfish, very abusively deceitful, contemptible cur, foul women of Australia, have spinelessly hidden with cowardly dishonesty from the principles and processes that they themselves have continued to make pretence to, making excuses to each other, whilst incessantly spinelessly oscillating between resorting to incessantly and self-servingly expediently making high profile pretence in the area of the principles and processes of justice, for example, pretence to behaviour according to what is fair, and right conduct, as implied in their political structure, legal culture, social structure and expressions of peer group approval, and resorting to incessantly and self-servingly expediently making high profile pretence in, in ignominious contrast, the area of what inflicting of cowardly abuse on men they are capable of getting away with, when persons call them out in said areas, as they carry on malevolently and destructively putting into effect their contemptibly cowardly abusiveness towards men from under the cover of their indignant, self-important, spineless hiding and their cowardly dishonesty, particularly targeting to inflict cowardly abuse on, persons that dare speak out against the horrifically dehumanising cowardly violence and abuse they have inflicted on men. 

People should still try to find the courage to speak out against their cowardly abusiveness. Perhaps someone amongst the abusively deceitful contemptible curs of the Australian mainstream media might do so, or perhaps not. It seems plainly untenable for the abovementioned abusively deceitful, spinelessly self-serving, gutless contemptible curs in Australia, including the subhumanly selfish, very abusively deceitful, contemptible cur, foul women of Australia, and filth that abuse men in a similar manner in other countries around the world, to continue with their extremely abusive, preposterously fraudulent intellectual bluff and their frequently pompous, self-important and indignant, ridiculous false facade of respectability, and for them to continue to very abusively hide on a massive scale from the principles and processes that they themselves make pretence to, with an unsurpassably high level of contemptible cowardice, as they have done on the specific matter of the abovementioned large-scale, mob-dynamic cowardly violence and abuse that they have inflicted, and have continued to inflict, on men.

2,Why do feminists consider all unattractive men misygonistic?,"I've seen 2 memes pushing this narrative go absolutely viral...

The first one was a screenshot of an overweight unattractive man in a YouTube video. The video title in this screenshot said ""Why women don't date me because of feminism. Part 1/80“

Come to find out. The video title was not that at all. He was talking about something completely underrated. But feminists decided to use this poor guy as a way to make ugly men out to be misygonists. 

This new meme I've seen going around is a pic of this acne-ridden guy with greasy unkept long hair with his supposed photo caption saying ""Feminism sucks. No more women for me! Women have became entitled."" 

There's no proof that the caption was not doctored like the last guy was. It's very well it could just be a screen grab of a man that just so happened to he unkempt and the feminist meme makers wanted to use his pic to push their anti ugly man agenda. 

I'm a man who's balding in my 20s. Our society is getting more and more feminist. I'm just so worried that women think I hate them because I'm ugly. I used to actually have an active sex life in my early 20s, but due to this ugly male propaganda I haven't been laid in years.",AskFeminists,1536135635,JoshTheWebDev,5,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9d4eyo/why_do_feminists_consider_all_unattractive_men/,2018-09-05
3,Does casual dating amount to dehumanizing your partner?,"This isn't 100% a feminism question, but I'd only trust feminists to answer it. Sorry for the length.

By ""casual dating"" I mean to date someone long enough to call each other boyfriend/girlfriend/partner, but without any intention of it becoming a serious relationship later down the road, whether or not casual sex is involved.

I understand it might sound pretty innocent, but here's what I mean. If you're just dating around to find out what you like, aren't you just treating the other person as a means to an end? If you're dating someone casually because you just went through a tough breakup and feel like you deserve something light and fun, aren't you using that person as a substitute for a feeling? If you pick someone you wouldn't ordinarily date because you're sick of being single, are they just an emotional crutch? If you date someone in college you know will be moving away in a couple of years, are they anything more than a placeholder for a person? If you feel sorry for your nice single friend and go out with them to boost their self-esteem, are you treating them as you would want to be treated?

It seems to me that in each of these cases, you'd be guilty of using your partner. But is there any way to casually date someone without using and dehumanizing them? I can't think of any.

One response I can hear is that as long as it's between two consenting adults, there's nothing wrong with it and we shouldn't judge them too harshly. But I think we can all agree that consent is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an action to be ethical. That is, for a relationship to be ethical, it must at a minimum be consensual, but it takes more than that. It must also be genuinely good in the long term for all parties involved. 

For instance, it wouldn't be ethical for two completely incompatible people to date each other just because they're both terrified of being alone, even if they both consent to it. Their incompatibilities will eventually make them unhappy, and dating someone out of fear of being alone is a dehumanizing motive. They could even hurt others if they have children.

Another response I can hear is ""As long as you're upfront about your motives, you're in the clear."" But few people have the fortitude to be upfront about those kinds of motives so directly. After all, who wants to ask someone (or hear): ""Will you be my practice girl/rebound/charity case?""

Besides, our motives are often obscure even to ourselves. We may not realize someone's a rebound until the relationship is over. So isn't the best way to keep away sort of unintentional dehumanizing to avoid casual dating altogether? If you're not really, truly excited about someone after a few dates, then isn't it unethical to continue dating them?

Since these sorts of relationships are so commonplace, I'm somewhat hesitant to call them unethical. I feel like I'm condemning at least 90% of the population. But I can't see any way around the conclusion, and it strongly affects my dating life.

That's because there's a personal side to this too. I told myself I was being too puritanical about dating, so I tried casually dating a woman once. She was fun to be around, and she really helped me feel more self-confident after a nearly life-ending bout of depression. She was just what I needed at that moment in my life. But I'm very introspective, so I couldn't help but realize that I was using her. And no matter how much it was helping me heal to have someone to cuddle with and shower me with kindness, it's wrong to use someone in that way as soon as you become aware of it. So it was only a couple of weeks before I broke up with her, and it was not long after that I started feeling depressed again, in part because I'm so deprived of intimacy. 

There's some part of me that still feels like I'm being ridiculous and unrealistic about my approach to dating, but my conscience won't be clear unless I can see why. Or if I'm not being ridiculous, then at least I'll feel more confident about refusing to date anyone for any reason who doesn't meet my possibly unrealistic standards. I can't seem to settle this on my own, so I would appreciate some outside perspective and wisdom.",AskFeminists,1536137457,SSLeon64,21,3,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9d4lac/does_casual_dating_amount_to_dehumanizing_your/,2018-09-05

9,Aren't most nice guys actually nice guys?,"Hey. I'm a normal guy. I play club Tennis, am almost done with college, and have a key few very important friends and quite a few lesser but still awesome other friends. Also, I have had a girlfriend for 3 years before we left highschool and went separate ways. I've been reading all this hate of ""nice guys"" online. Honestly, I've always considered myself a ""nice guy"" and always wondered why no girl has approached me in college vs other guys that are better looking, borderline abusive personality types. Granted, I've only ever asked out two girls ever, which is more about me being picky, I would have hoped by now that a girl showed interest in me.

But I do feel totally offended when people equate the feeling of being a nice guy to being an entitled monster. I mean, it's literally not about sex for me, I want to love someone, that's why I'm so picky to begin with. In many ways, I never really cared about sex. What I do care about is someone bullying me online for standing up to feminists that call a truly nice guy a toxic asshole without even knowing them. I truly feel like a lot of nice guys are actually nice, and perhaps there is certainly an aura of shallowness that surrounds dating. Specifically modern dating.

27,Fixing Culture Will Never Fix Humanity's Insecurities,"We make up culture through our actions and what we say.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only does culture determines what is masculine or feminine. Males have to be unrealistically masculine and females have to be unrealistically feminine in the eyes of the majority of society. This even changes from country to country and culture itself changes over time.

&amp;#x200B;

So it means we will be constantly insecure. Always feeling a certain image is being constantly shoved in our face. I think the only way to combat this is self improvement. Just because someone/everyone else has views on how a male and female should be like. Doesn't mean we have to comply to it or feel a sense of insecurity. We must be strong!

Also, even if we do criticize the majority or even become the majority. There will then always be a minority that will feel ridicule and insecure. Starting a vicious cycle over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll summarize the key points of the link with some quotes: 

 *In a new study at The Choice Lab, Ranveig Falch, Alexander W. Cappelen and Bertil Tungodden show that men are held accountable for their poor achievements to a greater extent than women are. ""We do not support men when they do poorly. However, we do support women"". (...)*  *If one has a positive attitude about helping capable women through gender quotas, one will perhaps also be more positive towards supporting women who do poorly than men who do poorly, Ranveig Falch, a doctoral student at NHH contends. (...)*  *“It is women and supporters of gender quotas who are responsible for the skewed distribution,” says Ranveig Falch. She presented the study at the Economic Science Association European Conference, which was recently hosted by The Choice Lab.* 

*In recent years, there have been several studies indicating that there is differential treatment of boys and girls in determining the outcome of achievements. Falch refers to findings by Cornwell, Mustard and Van Parys in 2013 in the USA, and Lavy in 2008 in Israel, who find that female teachers give better grades to girls than to boys for the same achievements. (...)*  *“It is not the case that the participants generally favoured women over men, or that they thought the women needed the money more. It is only when the reward is based on productivity that we see a difference in distribution among the genders,” says Falch.* 

&amp;#x200B;

46,A critique of Crenshaw's seminal intersectionality essay. Looking for feedback. Thoughts?,"I am looking for feedback on this piece which is largely critical of Crenshaw. Please, please, please be respectful. Please address the writing and its arguments, not the author. 

Here is the first paragraph:

	The term intersectionality, as related to discrimination and oppression, first appeared in Kimberle Crenshaw’s piece “Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics”. Crenshaw’s piece, though not without merit, serves as a poor introduction to whatever is meant by intersectionality. Not only does Crenshaw fail to define intersectionality, but her legal analysis includes almost no valid criticism. Where her arguments are valid they are obscured by the assumption of a unidirectional oppression matrix. Rather than providing an objective framework by which to analyze the interaction of various forms of discrimination, Crenshaw avoids measurability. She makes a veiled argument in favor of equality of outcomes and sets in motion a line of reasoning which, when taken to its natural conclusion, undermines equality by privileging the opinions of some people over others. It is important to carefully extract the good points from Crenshaw’s piece while clarifying where she goes wrong. Doing so will help combat the base incarnations of intersectional feminism while retaining the noble aspects of intersectionality.

51,"Are you biased, and if yes, what are you doing about it?","I used to consider myself a feminist. I hanged out on feminist forums, read news, discussed issues until I started noticing how biased I became against men, and how I was looking at every issue through feminist lens. 

I don't mind different opinions but I hate and always hated hypocrisy. And for me, being biased is the same thing as being hypocritical. Every problem that involved a person would become a feminist issue for me. I began seeing gender issues where there were none. I became seeing the world as black and white. I stopped being critical at all, until I criticized a feminist opinion about something I was very familiar with, and I was met with a backlash from similarly biased feminists who obviously had no experience in the issue. I saw my reflection in their reactions. Having no understanding on what's really going on, they immediately cried ""patriarchy"" even if the issue had nothing to do with gender at all. 

So, I stopped being a feminist, I stopped calling myself a feminist, stopped reading feminist publications and tried to be very, very neutral and very critical about every issue I ran into. I think, everyone is biased, but no matter what group are you a part of, you bias builds up according to your surrounding or to whatever information you let in.

54,"Why am I an evil ""fetishizer"" for being attracted to heavier/bigger women?","Title asks it all. I have a pretty wide range of women who I find attractive, but my primary go-to is BBW/larger women.

I hear heavier women always complain about how hard it is to get a guy that finds them beautiful, but when a fat admirer/BBW lover like myself comes along, we are accused of ""fetishizing"" or ""objectifying"" said person. For example, I was texting this one girl on Tinder. She hit on me sexually, and from there on, our conversations were mostly about sex and turn-ons. I told her about my belly expansion fetish, after which she asked me if my fat fetish was the only reason why I wanted to talk with her in the first place (it was one of several, she was also super chill, attractive, and easy to talk to).

Us men can't win. Likes skinny women = supports patriarchal beauty standards/discrimination against fat women. Likes fat women = objectifying them.

I mean, look, my best friend (female) was in a loving, healthy relationship with a guy for 5 years. She is specifically attracted to skinny guys and is grossed out by big muscles. Her then-boyfriend is a VERY skinny guy, and that's what initially attracted her to him. She even admitted to me that she would leave him if he gained a lot of weight.

But NOBODY has a problem with my female friend's preference for skinny guys, so why is it ""bad"" if I prefer heavier women?

Then again, I read this one Reddit post from a 40-something guy who talked about how he has always liked heavier women, and ended up marrying one. When they got intimate, he admired, loved and felt up every part of her body, and she cried from joy because no one had ever treated her that well before.

So, here is what I am asking.

#1. Why is it that my female friend is in the clear, the 40-something guy on Reddit is in the clear, but other men who like heavier women are ""objectifiers""?
#2. Why are heavier women sometimes okay with their partner's fat fetish, and other times not?

60,Germain Greer and the feminism of a twenty-something,"I was told not too long ago by a (male) friend of mine who’s opinion on many things I’m inclined to respect, that Germain Greer was one of the giants on who’s shoulders I stand. She has been instrumental in feminist debate and discussion for longer than I have been alive. Her works such as The Female Eunuch quite literally changed the face of feminism forever. She is partly responsible for the fact that I, a 25 year old white woman, am able to navigate the world as we know it in the way that I do. 

I was not alive during the period of feminism when she made her name. That world is something I struggle to relate to and in many ways am glad that I do not have to battle in the ways she did. Today’s feminism is a different creature, with different fights and, to a degree, different casualties. 

I would call myself a feminist. Recently I was amused at the hushed tones by which I was asked “would you call yourself a... *feminist*‽ yes. I would. The fight continues and I like to think in a more inclusive and intersectional way than ever before. 

Germain Greer has left me, to be blunt, furious. Her stance on pretty much every feminist issue is at odds with my own. How she views transgender folk, her comments on #MeToo, and most recently her work entitled On Rape have left me with bile in my throat and anger in my soul. 

Do others feel the same way? Do I give one of the Giants of Feminism a free pass? Am I missing a wider dynamic that I don’t fully understand?

I often find myself a little helpless when it comes to reacting when ""casual"" sexism occurs. I say ""casual"" because it's the common little things of every day life that are generally quite accepted in society. 

I'm thinking specifically about a few incidents that happened to me recently : a drunk guy motorboating between my boobs in a bar without my consent for ""fun"" and I was supposed to laugh it off (which sadly, I did), a guy who asked my male friend dancing right next to me if I was his girlfriend as if he was checking if I ""belonged"" to someone else before asking me to dance (which sadly, I did), a guy at work who keeps making inappropriate comments about my skirt being too short or my boobs grazing his arm when saying hello, this kind of things (which sadly, leaves me with no come back most of the times)...

73,Male friend had panic attack after being publicly called out for sexism in sociology class. What can I do to improve things?,"Hi all,

I'm a female biology major at a college in the Northeast. I'm minoring in gender &amp; women's studies, and encouraged one of my good male friends take a sociology class with me to fulfill an elective. He's very smart, an engineering major, and very kind. However, he is an international student from a more socially conservative country. He also suffers from social anxiety and depression, and has been seeing therapy for it (I didn't learn about this until recently). 

We were discussing in class how microaggressions are symptoms of larger oppressive structures in kyriarchy, with our professor bringing up Aziz Ansari's case in relation to #MeToo. We were having a group discussion, where my prof asked my friend what he thought (he's usually quiet), and my friend said he didn't think Aziz did anything wrong. After which, everyone else in the class (mostly women) harshly criticized him, justifiably so. He didn't understand the concept of enthusiastic consent previously, and was blinding by his male privilege to how this is a very common recurrence for women, that men don't understand ""no is no.""

Unfortunately, after everyone criticized his points one after one, the professor asked him what he thought, and he ran out of the classroom in a severe panic attack. I caught up to him to see if he was okay, and I took him to our local medical center because it was that bad. He told me has severe social anxiety and is always concerned about not saying the wrong thing, and was being excessively apologetic. He then told me about his mental illnesses and how he sees a therapist constantly. He says his worst nightmare is social humiliation for saying or doing the wrong thing. 

Since then, he hasn't come back to our sociology class out of shame, and is scared to. He's been more antisocial in general. t looks like he'll probably drop the class. 

What should I do to help him and be a good friend? Should I bring this up to my professor and classmates? While my friend was ignorant on the issue, he had positive intentions and is a good open minded guy, so I think it would have been better to make it an educational moment rather than pile on him super harshly. While he needs to develop thicker skin, I feel we should be cognizant of mental illnesses like anxiety and depression and low self-esteem as well.

103,Do Twitter/radical feminists give Feminism a bad name?,"A week ago I came to make a post about Twitter Feminism, in which most respondents just said that the problem is an isolated incident. I beg to differ. I believe that it's very widespread and causes problems for those on the other end trying to be on the same side as Feminists, half the time.  r/https://twitter.com/anniecuttle/status/1039644307660124165 

  
This thread is correct to assume that there was more to this story than just a girl leaving a guy after 5 years for his brother after making a proposal possible in Spider-Man itself. But gosh, the amount of comments where hating men is tolerated is just wrong. I consider myself a pretty normal person, and normal girls don't just type ""Fuck all cishet men"" to someone saying not to generalize breakup situations and the men in them. This is not an isolated incident. Another huge tweet was just someone saying men are better off never in power and anyone calling that out was piled up on and called sexist or fragile. It's only been 3 weeks on Twitter and it seems the stereotypes are true. Another example was a tweet calling out a male abuser rightfully, but then the comments were all about how to avoid men entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

Enough is enough. I understand that asking Feminists to call these guys out is like telling a Muslim to be responsible for Muslim terrorists, it doesn't work that way. But like Muslim terrorists, there's a part of the public that considers them in the same sphere of influence and thus lumps them in together, at the very least ideologically. I am Muslim, so if I were to apply what I think about extremists to this situation, I'd say the best thing you can do is actively disown them rather than ignore them. That's not the same as accepting claims that they are feminists.

104,Is this sexism?,"Hi all, I had a strange experience at work yesterday, and I thought I would ask you if it is sexist or not?

  
I work at a college broadcasting company, so all of the employees are college students. A group of about 10 of us were gathered around waiting for the shift to start. There are only 2 girls in our 27 person crew, and we were both there in this group of 10. The boys started talking about girl's names and our BOSS said, ""I've noticed that every single girl named Tyler is GORGEOUS. Like a knock-out. If you meet a girl named Tyler, you'll just think WOW."" and then all of the other guys started chiming in about how girls named Morgan are always gorgeous, how girls named Kayla are always gorgeous. And as a joke, I turned to my friend (the other girl) and said, ""Well this conversation got real sexist all of a sudden."" Our boss replied, ""How is this conversation sexist?"" and someone else said, ""If it's a compliment it's not sexist, right?"" To which I said, ""well when you generalize any group it's not a good thing, whether it's a compliment or not."" And everyone got really physically awkward and we moved on. However, throughout the shift, my boss kept finding ways to pointedly say, ""Well I wouldn't want to be SEXIST."" Which happened four or five times, and I eventually became the butt of the joke.

105,How much of a thing is TERF feminism in academia? (and other questions about TERFs),"Out of curiosity, I've been researching and reading contemporary theories on social structures and gender. I'm not an academic, but I'm very interested in academic studies, and I talk a lot about them with my friends who are in the academia.

What I found particularly interesting in my readings is that the most relevant ideas on these matters all seem to diverge from the ones of Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism. Not only that, they don't even bother to consider TERF ideas as something worthy of discussion. On the other hand, TERF feminism seems to reject ideas of all other fields of knowledge, both those that are more traditional and those that are more critical. For example, I've seen multiple TERFs completely disavow studies of subconscious, semiotics, linguistcs and even \*psychology\* (yes, the whole scientific discipline) as being ""postmodern bullshit"", inherently mysoginistic or harmful to feminism in any other way. 

In other words, it feels like TERF feminism lives in a different world than all other sciences. I expressed this impression to some of my feminist friends (who study anthropology and communication studies), and they basically said that criticizing trans-exclusionary feminism in academia is beating a dead horse because their ideas are simply outdated.

At the same time, I see a lot of TERFs with an academic background in my Facebook timeline. They are really vocal, and they defend that they have a pretty deep scientific basis and relevant researchers and intellectuals on their side.

So, I have a few questions. How relevant is TERF feminism in academia? If their theoretical basis is as solid and articulate as they claim, why don't they address questions raised to them by other fields of knowledge? And last but not least, if TERF feminism is indeed a ""dead horse"", how can it still be (at least a little) popular among feminists?

106,How to introduce young men to feminism?,"TLDR: Are there any digestable analogies that can demonstrate the objectives of third wave feminism to a boys-only class of receptive 16 and 17 year olds?

Full version: I am a Male English teacher in a boys-only high school. In one of my high ability senior classes, I was asked if a character we were studying could be considered a feminist icon. I hadn't considered an answer to that line of questioning when preparing the lesson but could definitely see the merits of it. I decided to allow the class to decide for themselves. 

I started the discussion by asking a student to explain what feminism was. Unfortunately, he responded with ""girly stuff."" I decided to end the discussion after admonishing the student and promised to return to it at a later date when I could more confidently answer.

In the past, I have tried to use short stories and analogies to at least give the boys some perspective of big issues. To give an example, I used an analogy on the sexual fetishization of black men to represent the ""otherness"" created as an undertone of racism. This was used to show that racism didn't just mean burning crosses and owning slaves. They didn't all immediately buy in but they at least realised that the issues were real and not always overt.

When I do return to the discussion of their sutudied character as a feminist, I would like to start by making the idea of feminism a lot more real to the boys - ideally through an analogy which demonstrates some of the undeniable and relatable truths that the modern feminist movement represents.

I would know since I've been into femdom for long, like many many men, most closeted since the work by men to deconstruct their own condition in a way that liberates them both from emasculation and toxic masculinity, to be empowered as individual, has not been done.  


Yet, one of my fantasies (if you can call that), has for long to be dominated by a or feminists women, in all sorts of power play and things that goes with it, but with everything I've read here and there, I'm wondering: are there any, some or a good number of feminist women into domination (or switching), since there seems to be an under-representation of feminists in BDSM circles and there seems to be lots of feminists into sexual submission (only an assumption) compared to the general women population?

 They  **say** they welcome trans men. However they also harbor gross bigoted and hateful attitudes towards trans men, when pressed on the subject.

But the word we use for them only refers to their bigotry against trans women, and neglects to describe or address their transphobic attitudes to trans men. It is trans women who the ""exclusionary"" in t**E**rf refers to as being excluded. But what about the guys?

This is erasure of the prejudice being experienced by trans men at the hands of (for want of a better term) TERFs, is it not? And we all know TERFs are perfectly happy to pretend trans men simply don't exist, most of the time, but we shouldn't do that just because they do!

115,A critique of Crenshaw's seminal intersectionality essay. Looking for feedback. Thoughts?,"I am looking for feedback on this piece which is largely critical of Crenshaw. Please, please, please be respectful. Please address the writing and its arguments, not the author. 

Here is the first paragraph:

The term intersectionality, as related to discrimination and oppression, first appeared in Kimberle Crenshaw’s piece “Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics”. Crenshaw’s piece, though not without merit, serves as a poor introduction to whatever is meant by intersectionality. Not only does Crenshaw fail to define intersectionality, but her legal analysis includes almost no valid criticism. Where her arguments are valid they are obscured by the assumption of a unidirectional oppression matrix. Rather than providing an objective framework by which to analyze the interaction of various forms of discrimination, Crenshaw avoids measurability. She makes a veiled argument in favor of equality of outcomes and sets in motion a line of reasoning which, when taken to its natural conclusion, undermines equality by privileging the opinions of some people over others. It is important to carefully extract the good points from Crenshaw’s piece while clarifying where she goes wrong. Doing so will help combat the base incarnations of intersectional feminism while retaining the noble aspects of intersectionality.

2. There is a bad women/good women dichotomy in drugs, rather you are a drug smuggler or a Nancy Reagan type drug warrior
3. Drug crimes takes resources from police departments, which could be used for rape cases (ever heard of unused rape test kits?)

130,Why do so many feminists think that enforced feminism is better than free choice feminism? (socialist feminism vs liberal feminism),"I'm writing from a scandinavian focus, which can be confusing at times, especially for people who live in conservative countries with very little feminist influence on their countries political agenda.

For example in Sweden, paid maternity leave is one year which is a great reform. However, three months are exclusively reserved for men (paternity leave). The social democrats and the left party want to implement shared maternity leave and paternity leave at 6 months, so that men and women are at home with their kids the same amount of time.

Now, as a liberal who doesn't think the government knows best and as a feminist, I really don't get why the government should meddle in family affairs. If a woman wants to stay at home with her kids during the whole maternity leave, and her husband is at work, why is that such a problem if that family has decided to do just that?

One of the reasons women still stay at home more with their children than men in Sweden is because families lose out economically if the person with the greater salary stays at home. The person with the greater salary is majorly men.

My solution to make men take out more paternity leave is to increase women's salaries and have more women at the top of the ladder, which would the decrease the economical tactical part of deciding who should stay at home and inspire women and men to decide based on their feelings and values, not if it's economically sustainable to be with your children.

I guess the greater question here is: why should women not be able to make their own decisions, even if those decisions aren't super feminist? Isn't women who make free choices the most feminist reasoning out there, but trusting the government to make those decisions for women very un feminist?

I mean the whole trope just baffles me to why so many men (and women) just laugh it off, it is literary the foundation of every toxic relationship.

I don't want to seem to much of a dick but surely men (and women) should realise how bad the commonality of this trope

If I paraphrase the common phrases 

'My wife/Gf hits me after/If I go out'

'She say she will leave me if I don't overspend on her'

'Those marks are from when she hits me after she gets mad'

'She makes me feel guilty if I don't sleep with her enough'

'She locked me out of the house/ Made me sleep on the sofa' (Even if she is the perp)

'She says i'm a cheat if I hang out with other women'

And most worryingly of all

'She broke my PC/trashed my things because she had a slight feeling of us breaking up'

'Lol my crazy ex is stalking me'

How are these things just swept under rug as some funny innocent thing?

It is just flat out toxic and coercive and yet men blame themselves for getting hit over stuff like this.

Common sense would show it's toxic.

170,Debating friends on both sides but would appreciate some clarity,"This is a bit long winded, and I apologize if that is frowned upon here, but really could use some insight from others. 

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, I am a white cis male that does identify as a feminist.  Regarding any kind of statement that generalizes any group, I do not jump on board with.  I try my very hardest to always take a step back and look at situations on an individual level.  

&amp;#x200B;

So a friend of mine posted a link to Facebook (maybe some of you have seen it) from someone with the last name of Blair stating that all pregnancies are 100% men's fault.  I read the article (tweet storm to be a little more precise), and even though I fully agree with what her goal of the article was (female reproductive rights), I did not agree nor like the content of the tweets.  That's fine, she has every right to say what she said, I have every right to my opinion of how she said it.  I made my rebuttal of some of the views Ms. Blair stated and claimed that I disagree with the ""every pregnancy is a man's fault"" part and respectfully ended my statement about not jumping on any view that generalizes an entire group.  Now one of my childhood friends comes across this and starts spewing some pretty wild opinions.  Stated that women shouldn't be allowed to vote, that women have the most amount of freedom and are as miserable as ever, shouldn't be allowed to work - some pretty archaic thoughts here.  Of course I take the bait and engage, but his opinions are just so absurd to me that I don't even know how to actually debate him intellectually.  Realistically, how often do female feminists hear these statements?  I really hope that this is not a common thought, but I could just be in my bubble.  And as far as the article goes, how do people feel about that?  I personally felt that both were ridiculous - obviously one more so than the other - and just can't help but hope that I'm not crazy or ignorant for my own beliefs.

176,Have socialists hijacked the feminist movement which from the beginning was a movement with roots from liberalism?,"From the beginning, feminism was a liberal movement. Women in the ""burgeoise"" class were sick and tired of being second class citizens compared to men. Burgeoise women organized themselves, and most oftenly had the resources to afford education, read books and learn about ideology. They had the means to indoctrinate burgeoise men, and women from the burgeoise were the first women to be handed positions in political parties. Their goal was to enmancipate every living woman, and that's why liberal women died in the fight for women's right to vote. 

These women were also crucial in the fight for, women's rights to work, women's right to educate themselves, women's right to health and reproductivity etc. Liberals stood by the barricades and defended liberal ideas and women's rights from conservatives. A lot of crucial liberal thinkers in favor of women's enmancipation were seen as paria by the majorly conservatives.

Liberals have always been the anti thesis of the conservatives. When the conservatives tried to hold on to opression, liberals fought back.

In short words, the liberal movement has been crucial in attaining human rights, free speech, religious freedom and freedom from religion etc.

However, todays feminism seems hijacked by socialists. Why? Many of todays feminists call themselves socialists despite the fact that the ""proletariat"" have a really bad track record when it comes to human rights and women's rights. When liberal women and men were organizing and having book circles about the empancipation of women in the 19th century, the proleteriat and the socialists were just as skeptical to women as the conservatives. There is very few known women from the socialist movement back in the days, while there are dozen of liberal women known for their fight against the misogynistic oppression.

Even in more modern times, women were not at the forefront in socialist uprisings. Women in the communist party in USSR had very little showing, and the party was mostly dominated by men. Other socialist states in the past were male dominated. Socialism in itself doesn't care about women because it doesn't concern itself with gender - only class. We all know that a classless society will still have patriarchal structures that need to be dealt with directly and not indirectly. But socialism doesn't deal with those structures efficently enough. 

Liberalism is feminism. It's about the freedom of choice. To choose if a woman want to have an abortion or not without involvement of the state. To choose if a woman want to stay at home with their children or work.

So why are socialists hijacking feminism? And why do socialist feminists not respect the liberal roots that feminism actually has? Feminist women who are also socialists hate feminist women with liberal views, and this is extremely worrying.

12,Why does nobody complains of Black-washing in media? [double standard],"While this isn't related directly with women issues, feminist groups have been very vocal regarding representation of minorities  in the media.

Couple years ago, there was a online outrage of allegedly ""white washing"" in the Marvel's Iron Fist, even though Danny Rand in the comics is[ whiter than Matthew Perry](https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2016/usgamer/Iron-Fist-Shot-01.jpg/EG11/resize/320x-1/quality/80)  Social Justice groups also bashed hard in Gods of Egypt for casting a [Scot ](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NDMwMzc4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4Nzg4Mg@@._V1_UY317_CR6,0,214,317_AL_.jpg)and a [Scandinavian ](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3Mjg0Mzc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzODMzMzI@._V1_SX1500_CR0,0,1500,999_AL_.jpg)as Egyptian gods.

However, I just noticed that Thor in MCU was very ""black washed"".  Heimdal, The Valkyrie and one of Thor companions were changed  from their comic counterparts. These two characters while being obviously fictional are inspired in Scandinavian culture, Heimdal being a God in Norse paganism and Valkyries, mystical beings.

Historical shows also were notoriously black-washed in the recent past. BBC's Troy features an african-european Achilles (which was notoriously described as a greek and blonde in the Illiad) and  an african-american [Margaret of Anjou](https://images.spot.im/v1/production/xoenvzs29ggu4ukrkabe) in the Hollow Crown.

Certainly, Brad Pitt isn't ethinically greek, but he could easily pass as greek with makeup and a tan.

I am familiar with the idea of distributive justice (sometimes called ""social justice) and I see how it should be applied to eg affirmative actions to correct past inequalities. What I don't understand is how people think it's OK to completely characterize beloved comic characters or historical figures and **under the same premises** complain when it happens to their disliking.

22,How can we make 'sexual capital' equal between men and women?,"Until men and women have the same sexual capital: they cannot be said to be equal.  


Sexual capital provides a number of advantages in life. If either sex has much more sexual capital than the other: it becomes a commodity that can be used to trade an take advantage of the opposite sex. For example: more women can, if they choose, get paid for sex with men than vice-versa.   


Presumably this must be understood as a product of the fact that men value female sexuality more than women value male sexuality.  


It seems to me that, from the male point of view, from the male subjective experience: women have a lot of power when it comes to ""gate-keeping"" the thing they (generally speaking) want the most in life. Good luck to any man in trying to get an equal sexual exchange with a woman who sees here sexuality as worth the same as his: casual-sex for casual-sex, pleasure for pleasure. Whilst there are promising signs that casual-sex culture is on the rise: most men, at some time or other, will experience an entitlement from women to, basically, get more in exchange for sex (money, free meals, free dates, monogamy). I have, countless times, we can blame the patriarchy if we want: that bullshit has to end.  


From my point of view, as a man, there is a kind of game going on with feminism: we'll pretend we have no real advantages over men, we'll create a society whereby men and women are (by some measures) equal, when men say they experience women having power over them we'll just ignore them (whether or not it's true).

29,Practical Advice on Helping a fried/domestic violence victim,"HELP!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in Seattle Washington, and I'm a 28 year old gay male, with a financial job.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm friends with a girl I have known for about 1.5 years. She is in a very difficult situation. She works at a restaurant, she had a baby last fall and she doesn't have much of a career or college degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is living with her child's father, and he is physically and emotionally abusing her. Last week she had a bunch of large abrasions on her arm. She also has asked me for advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I'm going to tell her that its wrong in all cases for someone to leave a mark on you out of violence (she is still in denial on weather or not its her fault) 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I think she should probably go to the Dr, and have the injuries he left on her documented. Then seek social service help on moving. I'm willing to help her through the paperwork (I'm really really good at paperwork)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very worried about her, as I know the statistics on female homicide. Please help talk me through the next couple steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions: 

\-Will a normal Dr know how to respond to this? 

\-Would Planned Parenthood work? 

\-Can I trust a Dr will follow through and actually help?

\-Are there organizations that will know how to respond to this? If yes, then who are trustworthy ones? 

\-I work at a Law firm, should I perhaps call around and see if a family lawyer will take her on Pro-Bono? 

\-How can I do any of this without risking violent retaliation from her partner? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background, even though I'm male, I was the subject of some pretty horrible abuse as a child. It causes me much pain to know she is going through this, and I want to help in any way thats reasonable. I believe her to be a good person.

57,Equal paying when it comes to private sport teams,"What is your opinion about the prospect of sport brands/companies paying the same wage to both the male and female sport teams? Does this scenario have much chance to happen (It already happened, such as the case of Lewes FC in England) in a national scale?

If it is about national sport teams, then equal paying is a must because both teams are playing for national pride, and beside, this is a great chance for the government to promote gender equality.

But to the owners/investors of sport teams, the athletes are entertainers and the matches are entertaining products to make money from. And unlike movies or albums -you can not tell that audiences are attracted to a particular work because of the artists' genders, or that male artists contributed more than female artists- people already have a bias toward male sport teams to female teams, and therefore are more likely to spend money on the former than the later (and not just to watch the matches, but also to buy products advertised by male athletes and the likes.)

And if members of a sport teams are being paid not only by how well they are playing on the field, but also by how much profit they bring to the owners/investors, wouldn't it be natural for the males to be paid more than the females?

I really hope what I've just stated is wrong. I don't know whether this is true in your country, but in my countries female athletes are severely underpaid  despite their many achievements. The growth of many talents have been stunted because of that. They deserve to be paid much more than now, but should it be as high as their male counterparts remains a question.

I suppose that the best way to give the investors/owners incentives to pay more for female athletes is by making female sport teams just as popular and profitable. But the time and money pour into training, marketing,etc. of this will be very high, and requires the cooperation of the government and the private sector (you need to make an entire league/tournaments to be more attractive to sport fans, and not just a single team). I don't think there will be many willing to take that huge risk.",AskFeminists,1535116808,Fireminer,0,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/99xcr0/equal_paying_when_it_comes_to_private_sport_teams/,2018-08-24

65,"If men make up the majority of labor-type jobs, how can we ever achieve gender equality in employment?","In USA/Canada the population is more or less split down the middle (approximately 50/50 men and women).  If men hold the majority of physical labor intensive type jobs (construction, roofing, landscaping, lumberjacks, steel workers etc.) does this not create a surplus of women for the remainder of all jobs (ie. non physical labor intensive jobs).

I guess an example would be that if you had 50 men and 50 women all looking for jobs, and one job requires 20 people for heavy labor.  So as society goes they hire 20 men and nobody complains, as expected, because it is generally accepted that men (remember IN GENERAL) are more physically capable to perform these tasks.  Society and the media do not make a stink about this gender imbalance because I believe that society generally accepts that men are generally stronger (in general I want to repeat this again before someone says ""I know a woman who is stronger than a man"", ok ok you know an exception, I'm talking in general here).

Now you have 30 men left and 50 women left for the non labor intensive jobs.  So they hire everyone, and now you have a surplus of women in these non labor intensive jobs, and this is seen as an issue because... patriarchy?

The way I see it is that you have more people to choose from for the non-labor type jobs, considering both men and women can (theoretically) perform these tasks equally, so from an economical point the overall value of these positions decreases due to supply and demand.

I believe this plays hand in hand into how much these types of positions get paid as well.  If you can only hire physically enabled men for a certain position, and you could hire ANYONE for an administrative role, wouldn't you value the physical roles slightly higher and pay accordingly, because those positions are harder to replace (ie. less people applying due to half the population unable/unwilling to do this type of job)?.",AskFeminists,1535127441,Byck,24,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/99ys9w/if_men_make_up_the_majority_of_labortype_jobs_how/,2018-08-24

112,Men &amp; Women Differences,"I feel like I'm about to ask the white guy's feminism 101 question, but I'm willing to throw it out there and learn. I didn't see this idea as a headline on any other post, but I'm sure it's scattered throughout the sub reddit so I apologize in advance if this is a tired topic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Disclaimers to Set the Stage**

First off, I'm all for equity/equality across gender, and in general, I would like to think I'm on the side of feminists.

Also, I feel like I need to throw out the disclaimer that any generality/stereotype should never be imposed on a individual, we are much too complex to do that.

  
OK. So here's the thought/question with just a little more setup (sorry for burying the lead):

I don't think men and women are exactly the same -I'm guessing feminists don't either. And while I do think our opportunities should be equal, I think, for example, women are better than men at certain things. I think that's great. There are a whole bunch of stereotypes about what these topics may be, but I think examples might distract from my point.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we are different and I think that's wonderful and that those differences shouldn't hold any gender back. I'd like to be able to have a fair and just world all around but I also don't want us to lose sight that (in general) there are some differences between men and women and I wouldn't judge them on whole as better or worse, just different.  


And to clarify, I am suggesting something more than people are different. I actually think there is something a bit more biological or perhaps cultural, let's call it a general pre-disposition, to interpret or do things differently that are directly tied to our gender.

&amp;#x200B;

The question: How do you react to this perception? Do you agree? is it counter to feminism? Is there some perspective I should consider that I'm not?

114,What do feminists think of the beauty bias? Will it ever go mainstream?,"From an article:

 *IT’S NOT your imagination: Life is good for beautiful people. A drumbeat of research over the past decades has found that attractive people earn more than their average-looking peers, are more likely to be given loans by banks, and are less likely to be convicted by a jury. Voters prefer better-looking candidates; students prefer better-looking professors, while teachers prefer better-looking students. Mothers, those icons of blind love, have been shown to favor their more attractive children.* 

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who always has always been above average in terms of attractiveness, I've also noticed over the years that people tend to treat me better than my uglier male and female friends and coworkers, no matter how much more confident or intelligent than me they look. It doesn't always happen but it usually does and after having a look at the research I think we are both biologically and socially motivated to discriminate those who are less attractive and treat better those who are better looking.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I try to be kinder to people who is uglier than the average, because I believe it's the right thing to do. I remember when I was a kid, other kids picked on the fat, ugly, short, etc, and I think that many less attractive people tend to grow as insecure adults and have more mental health problems related to self-esteem, anxiety and depression. I also should say I try not to look my best since being above average in terms of attractiveness is a privilege and therefore it oppresses people who are below average, even if that's not my intent.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the different feminist perspectives on this issue? Will it ever go mainstream enough for people to fight for their rights to be treated equally or is there a stigma around identifying oneself as ugly? Is beauty bias idea wrong and there is no discrimination towards less attractive people? To what extent does this issue affect an individual's life? Will be ever get rid of it? What can we do?

124,Is it ok to support women accused of rape or sexual harassment without knowing the full facts?,"I asked this at AskWomen too, but I would like to hear what the contributors here think also!

https://old.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9awxqo/is_it_ok_to_support_women_accused_of_rape_or/

I came across this statement today (by Judith Butler, a feminist scholar of note), and I was struck by the level of hypocrisy shown

""Although we have no access to the confidential dossier, we have all worked for many years in close proximity to Professor Ronell and accumulated collectively years of experience to support our view of her capacity as teacher and a scholar ... We have all seen her relationship with students, and some of us know the individual who has waged this malicious campaign against her. We wish to communicate first in the clearest terms our profound an enduring admiration for Professor Ronell whose mentorship of students has been no less than remarkable over many years. We deplore the damage that this legal proceeding causes her, and seek to register in clear terms our objection to any judgment against her. We hold that the allegations against her do not constitute actual evidence, but rather support the view that malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare. ""

After all we could just change all the names, work field, and turn around the gender identifiers, and we have this...

""Although we have no access to the confidential dossier, we have all worked for many years in close proximity to Harvey Weinstein and accumulated collectively years of experience to support our view of his capacity as producer and a mentor ... We have all seen his relationship with actors, and some of us know the individual who has waged this malicious campaign against him. We wish to communicate first in the clearest terms our profound an enduring admiration for Mr Weinstein whose mentorship of actors has been no less than remarkable over many years. We deplore the damage that this legal proceeding causes him, and seek to register in clear terms our objection to any judgment against him. We hold that the allegations against him do not constitute actual evidence, but rather support the view that malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare.""

Now personally I think Weinstein is almost certainly gulity, and I cannot imagine anyone seriously posting a statement supporting him (in the press) that would be similar to my rewording of the statement supporting Prof Ronnel, but what I don't grasp is how a feminist with such a history of campaigning for women to be treated equally and who is so vehemently supportive of the victims of rape and sexual assault can say something like this.

Unless she is a hypocrite perhaps?

134,A question.,"I’m going to try my best to keep this simple. 

I’ve always been a more effeminate man. Back in the day, I guess the word metrosexual, was the only word that I felt described me. All my life, Guys usually never liked me.  They had this assumption that I was gay. And those that did take me under their wing, felt it was their obligation to toughen me up to become more manly. 

In high school a girl lied to everyone saying that I beat her up, just because We had a falling out, because I called her friends out for making fun of a gay kid. She sent any guy that would act like a white knight for her, to fight me. 

After hs, I dated an extreme feminist that really beat me down and she’s proud of it. She would compare me to men physically and financially. She would always feel the need to remind me that I was never good enough until I was successful. She said she’s didn’t need me. She could find a better guy easily. And I would never find a girl that would love me because i couldn’t man up. There was also this moment where she smacked a guys ass behind my back, and then yelled “ow ow!” To him. Honestly I shoulda had more self respect. I think she prayed on the fact that I had a lot of self doubt at the time. She told me she acted these ways to me because that is how guys have acted to her and she felt I deserved it. 

Now where I work. They really try an impress gender roles on me. First off. Let me say I’m a server/bartender. And when I am helping guests. A lot of people (guys and girls) will be gross and make a sexual comment or try to grab my ass or dick. People will sometimes even try to fight me for no reason. When I complain about it, I get shamed for even complaining, because I’m a dude and I should be expected to take it. The other thing I have noticed is the girl servers will receive this. And when they do, all the guy employees jump into white knight 
Mode and will forcibly kick out anyone who harassed these girls. 

Now I’m not saying the extreme actions of one represent the whole community of the group that backs them. But here’s where I’m at. As a feminine straight (white) male. I feel feminists target me because they think My problems are irrelevant and that I have been privileged when I never have been.  Can you shed some light on your thoughts on this? in your eyes, do I deserve the harassment?

I felt hurt and thought the opposite end of things like mgtow would understand me. But they are the types that believe man should be man and women should be women. So they can’t sympathize for me. I tried lgbt. But it seems like they all think I’m gay and since I’m not admitting that I’m gay, then I must be closeted and too afraid to come out. (Also I recently went to a pride event where some drag queens sexually assaulted me on stage when I was participating in a dance contest by tearing my clothes off me. The crowd of gay men applauded it.) 

It seems there is a huge stigma behind feminine men. I want to find a group where I belong. Someone that can see me and see the abuse I’ve gone though and tell me I don’t deserve it. Because it seems like all my life has been filled with people that tell me I do deserve it. Or at the very least shouldn’t complain about it. 

TLDR; I am a openly feminine straight man who has been ridiculed and shamed most my life. Now I’m trying to find a group that can sympathize and understand me but I don’t know who to go to. I just want to belong. I feel alone in this.

Suppose you have a 9 months old fetus inside of you. It causes pain/stress etc... It uses your body. Would it be against feminist ideals to kill it by denying it access to your body?

Ignore any pragmatics about medical procedures - I just want to understand the morality and feminist thinking behind it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would answers change if the 9 month old fetus is replaced by the mother of the person in this hypothetical? Irrespective of how the mother would use your body, just assume she does in some way, and that denying her access would kill her. Then, in situation 1, there are no effects on you, and in situation 2 there are negative effects on you (resulting from her use of your body in whatever way).

154,Question on Privilege,"I feel as if the word 'privilege' isnt the right word for what it means. What I mean is: an example of male privilege is that men can comfortably walk along the street without getting harassed and catcalled (most of the time at least), while women walking along the street will almost definetly have it happen. But in this case, I dont think privilege is the best way to describe it. To me, saying it is privilege implies the man is the one treated specially here- as in, the norm should be that all people should be catcalled, but men are able to not be. But most people would call for the opposite- nobody should be catcalled. Thus, it is not so much that men are privileged as it is women are disprivileged.

156,I'm confused about consent and would like some advice before I start sexual/romantic relationships,"Hi,

I have a few queries regarding consent that I thought you might be able to help me out with.

I've heard several different views on consent for sexual acts and how this works. I know a little bit about enthusiastic consent, but I'm not sure how I'll be able to pragmatically understand this in a social/sexual situation. 

I have autism to the degree where I cannot effectively or accurately judge body language and facial expression. I have major difficulty understanding enthusiasm in tone of voice and subtle inflections of voice which might make the difference between an enthusiastic 'yes', and a unenthusiastic 'yes'. If a girl looks uncomfortable during or before sex, I will probably be unable to accurately judge this unless they tell me to stop outright. Whilst I will not willingly coerce a girl into sex, I fear that my disability will cloud me accidentally doing so without me knowing that I'm doing so.  

I know that this might affect things as often in real life I find out later than I came across as strange and ignoring boundaries in social situations in general without me knowing that I did anything wrong at the time. Whilst I have been putting effort into understanding more about social situations my entire life, people don't realize that I will always find it difficult to adapt to these situations and that I do not have the cognitive tools available to most people that allows me to analyse social situations to the accuracy other people are able to do so. I'm honestly afraid that I will unknowingly hurt my partner, as I understand that consent is more subtle than what I'm able to judge.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",AskFeminists,1535578537,Ultradrakemail,28,37,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9bdiqu/im_confused_about_consent_and_would_like_some/,2018-08-29

158,Are current conversations of sexual coercion going too far?,"For example, let's take the case of the lead singer of indie band Pinegrove, Evans Stephens Hall. Back in November 2017, Hall [sent a message](https://www.facebook.com/Pinegroveband/posts/a-message-from-evani-am-about-to-talk-about-something-serious-and-i-want-to-begi/10155748505559774/) on the band's Facebook page apologizing for what he believed to be ""sexual coercion"" against a woman, who he met when she was just a fan of the band (for a better telling of this, I would recommend reading [the in-depth Spin article](https://www.spin.com/featured/punk-talks-pinegrove-controversy/) about the situation, which also involves a therapy group called Punk Talks and how the accusations were mishandled). A few things that I found strange:

\-Hall describes in detail various ways that he thought there was a mutual relationship with this person:  he ""believed we were mutually in love and we said it to each other often;"" after the lady fan (voluntarily, I presume) broke up with her boyfriend ""she met my parents...we discussed eventually moving in together;""  he ""absolutely never threatened her... never leveraged anything against her;"" he believed all of their actions ""to be based in love."" The lady never released her own full account of the story, but based on this description alone most reasonable people would conclude that the relationship was consensual. 

\-Despite this, Hall states that he ""monumentally misread the situation."" Why? Well, because she was a fan, I guess, and there were ""power dynamics"" at play. Apparently, to him, Hall believes that he used his power to sleep with the fan. Hall then had this paragraph:

"" i should have more actively acknowledged my position of power as a public figure, and also as a man. i have always tried to approach all of my relationships under the premise of equality, but i see now more clearly that the inherent privilege of my gender and the accumulated privilege of being a recognized performer most certainly impacted this interaction.""

The reason why I'm using this as an example because, even though feminists and proponents of stuff like #MeToo are saying that they aren't trying to engage in a sex panic, that they aren't trying to create a culture of victimhood (something I believe), I think that this is an example of the conversation of power and coercion turning into a dangerous one where essentially no woman or non-famous person is responsible for loving or engaging sexual relations with a man or a famous person.  Hall obviously disagrees and he's entitled to that. But let's hypothetically take his statement at face value: what kind of explanation would lead him to believe this about him in the first place?

A grown man was engaged in a mutually consensual relationship with a grown woman, with someone who he didn't have a professional relationship with, the only problem was that maybe the lady regretted it and...it was coercion? What? Where was the force? Where was the pressure? And then the guy tries to apologize for being intimate with some fans but like...they were consensual so what's the big deal? Is any fan that wants to get intimate with an artist just subconsciously coerced to it because of some subjective interpretation of ""power""? Where's the agency on the woman's part in all this discussion of gendered privilege? This doesn't feel right at all.  

A lot of the Facebook comments (from men and women) have people being confused, feeling like Hall left details out in this statement while mostly agreeing that he did nothing wrong. Do you agree? If you disagree, then why do you believe they're wrong?",AskFeminists,1535592354,notrandyjackson,4,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9bf9pg/are_current_conversations_of_sexual_coercion/,2018-08-29

160,"What do you think of this new study that found in Teen dating violence is down, but boys still report more violence than girls?","When it comes to teen dating violence, boys are more likely to report being the victim of violence—being hit, slapped, or pushed—than girls. That’s the surprising finding of new research from the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University.

Overall, fewer teens are reporting experiencing physical abuse from their dating partners, with five per cent of teens reporting dating violence in 2013, down from six per cent in 2003.

However, the researchers found 5.8 per cent of boys and 4.2 per cent of girls said they had experienced dating violence in the past year.

First author Catherine Shaffer, a PhD student from SFU who was involved in the study, says more research is needed to understand why boys are reporting more dating violence.

“It could be that it’s still socially acceptable for girls to hit or slap boys in dating relationships,” she said. “This has been found in studies of adolescents in other countries as well.”

She added that the overall decline in dating violence, while small, is encouraging.

“Young people who experience dating violence are more likely to act out and take unnecessary risks, and they’re also more likely to experience depression or think about or attempt suicide,” Shaffer said. “That’s why it’s good to see that decline in dating violence over a 10-year span. It suggests that healthy relationship programs are making an impact among youth.”

The study is the first in Canada to look at dating violence trends among adolescents over time, and the first in North America to compare trends for boys and girls. Researchers analyzed data from three B.C. Adolescent Health Surveys involving 35,900 youth in grade 7 to 12 who were in dating relationships.

Elizabeth Saewyc, senior study author and UBC nursing professor, said the findings highlight the need for more support programs for both boys and girls in dating relationships.

“A lot of our interventions assume that the girl is always the victim, but these findings tell us that it isn’t always so,” said Saewyc. “And relationship violence, be it physical, sexual or other forms, and regardless who the perpetrator is, is never OK.

161,Is r*** sometimes evaluated in distorted ways?,"This might be controversial but it's important for me personally, and maybe for other people too, so that's why I ask. If rape is a really sensitive issue for you you should probably stop reading.

I wanted to say ""blown out of proportion"" in the title, instead of ""viewed in distorted ways"" but I understand that would be pretty insensitive. But to be straightforward that really is the gyst of what I am asking.

Rape is sometimes included with murder, as the two crimes which warrant capital punishment, for one example of how bad people think rape is.

But I was raped and it wasn't even a big deal. In fact I enjoyed it. I was ""a virgin"" (if you believe in that construct.) I felt maybe a little bit violated for a couple days, but at the end of the day I decided to take my rapist as my partner and we had lots of great sex. for years. I learned a lot. It was nice. I'm glad we started when we did.

(Other times I have been raped and I carry those scars of betrayal and violation with me for life, so I'm not trying to just say it's not a big deal.)

I feel like sometimes people forget that sometimes rape isn't that bad, just because sometimes it is really bad?

This is in no way an endorsement of rape, because some rapes are fatal or worse, and that's a risk you should never take for someone else unless you're sure.

(in my case, the first time, I already said we would have sex ""in a few days"" or something and I was basically just being a tease. there was no force involved. I think there was very little risk of me being traumatized in any way. I definitely did not say no once it had begun, but minutes previously I had said no for that day.)

Is there room for a more nuanced understanding of rape, or is it the ethically on par with murder? Could rape ever be a minor violation, or even 'justified,' as I feel mine was? (not as a punitive measure or entitlement, but as a favor?)

Does it have to be such a big deal all the time? If someone was raped, or raped someone, maybe they don't need to feel so bad all the time in every situation? Maybe people don't need to catastrophize what isn't catastrophic, even if it is technically a violation? And does that sometimes happen? 

What harm can be done by taking a one dimensional view toward the impacts of such an act? Does a black and white approach to sexual violation erase the uniqueness of individual experiences? In my case it does.",AskFeminists,1535634163,0O00OOO0000OOOOO0000,1,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9bjfg3/is_r_sometimes_evaluated_in_distorted_ways/,2018-08-30

182,TIL: Most Casting Directors for Hollywood Movies are Female.,"[https://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/resources/top-25-power-casting-directors-in-film-and-tv/](https://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/resources/top-25-power-casting-directors-in-film-and-tv/)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/video/5-casting-directors-why-females-665584](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/video/5-casting-directors-why-females-665584)

&amp;#x200B;

Actor here. I wanted to discuss. There has been a lot of talk about how Hollywood is sexist. I do agree but whenever this conversation comes up, I constantly hear women (even my actress friends) blame it on men who are misogynistic.

Most of the women I met will talk about the unrealistic and unhealthy beauty standards set out by films. they will talk about race issues with casting and also how it's usually these sex symbol types of women that get cast in major roles.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I totally get the reasoning, but it seems a lot of misunderstandings from those who are not involved in the film industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is true that most men are actors, but it seems that most women tend to work in the background jobs of the film industry (producers, agents, cds). I am unable to find statistics in this (on the casting directors distribution for gender), but much of films have female casting directors. You could say it's almost over represented, if not equally distributed. I would imagine this is because the job itself is a very unpredictable and unreliable job. You definitely cannot expect a stable salary if you want to have kids. I can see why women would go into a different branch in the film industry.

&amp;#x200B;

The casting director will receive over 400 submissions for a role. Her job is usually to pick whatever she feels fits best for the film, usually interpreted from the notes of what the director gave or what the writer had written for the character. This power is never to be underestimated. The director will have the final call for what he wants, but the CD is what offers him his selections. The casting director will also try to balance things like marketability. It's kinda sad because there was an interview (don't remember where) with a female casting director who said she would hesitate to cast a gay actor as a romantic lead in a film. She said it was because most of the time, romance film consumers are women and most women would rather fantasize about a heterosexual male actor than a homosexual male actor playing a heterosexual character. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is why for many actor's it's not about getting in the good books with a director, but rather getting along and the attention of a casting director.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from something cool I just learnt today, I also wanted to open up a discussion. How do feminists smooth out this paradox? We say that the film industry is sexist, but we also have women with much power in the industry contributing to it too. Yes, most directors and writers are male, but it seems most women are choosing to go into a different career path in the industry. These women also have a lot of power in the casting decisions. They receive 200-500 submissions depending on the role being called for casting. You could say a casting director does have a creative input into the film. This is often not known to the public, just like how sometimes a film is not actually the vision of the director or writer but rather the producer (this person basically finances the film and hires the crew and takes care of paperwork. they can hire a writer to fulfill the producer's vision).

199,Genuine question about a current issue in the League of Legends community,"So I'm a guy, and I definitely support equality for women, but there's an issue that's current going on in the League of Legends (online PC videogame for those who don't know) community that I'm not sure if I've misunderstood or if the vast majority sentiment is wrong or what.

So there's been a bunch of stuff coming out recently about how the developers of the game, Riot Games, harbour very male-dominant auras within working for them going right up to the original founders of the company, and female staff being overlooked, treated differently, etc. etc. and the LoL subreddit was bringing some of this stuff right up to the top, obviously there are people saying stupid stuff but clearly overall people support the publication and bringing to light of all of this stuff and demanding things to change etc. Here are a couple of the threads of the big submissions of articles/blogs that are within the top voted posts of the last month

https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/95t5z7/inside_the_culture_of_sexism_at_riot_games/

https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9aslos/the_story_of_why_i_left_riot_games_barry_hawkins/

But so now there's another current issue which revolves around something that Riot have implemented at PAX, a gaming convention, presumably as part of their response to addressing all of these concerns, because Riot in general has been seen has a pretty *good* company overall, in terms of their perceived values, openness, design philosophy etc etc, which is partially why this whole issue was so unexpected.

So at Riot's PAX showcase or whatever it is, it seems like they're having a morning of presentations on various departments of the company that are open only to women and non-binary people, and after 2:30pm anyone is allowed in and there'll be Q&amp;A and other stuff after etc etc

And the community has completely blown up about this, what feels at the moment like almost to the same degree as the original revelations, about how this is the completley wrong approach, this is still sexism but just in the opposite direction, it's excluding an entire sex from the event etc etc. This is the largest thread at the moment of a Rioter's reaction to reddit discussing it.

Now I can see how aspects of this are perhaps not the right approach, in that I do think that in empowering women overall, men should be included, but from what I can tell, the intention of the action was to create a space for women/non-binary people alone such that they would feel more encouraged to apply to work at the company and stuff like that.

The arguments being put forward in these threads are around like segregation, that if it was women being excluded from presentations at the company, it would be an absolute outrage, and how if you want to encourage discussion around the area then everyone should be involved etc etc, and I just feel like, sure, in an ideal world, that's how you would want to do it, but if such a large group of people are finding it difficult to approach the whole area, or considering working within videogames and stuff, you can't just say 'we encourage women to consider working here!!' and that's it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9c5283/im_really_proud_of_the_league_community_right_now/

Normally I'm pretty aware of what's nonsense and clearly misguided opinion, but the reason why I'm coming here is because I find it so confusing that so many people are so strongly against this action, that have I actually got it wrong? Like, this is the same group of people that's been calling Riot out for all of the sexism and mistreating of women at the company, so it's not just like 'oh it's the internet, just some ignorant people', that makes me question the whole thing, and have I misinterpreted it myself, and underestimated the potential for 'reverse sexism'? I mean it seems there are plenty of people supporting women's equality, including women as well, decrying this action from Riot as completely in the wrong direction and this is vastly the predominant sentiment amongst the community, and so I just don't understand if I've got it wrong or what - I completely agree that no group of people should be actively discriminated against, minority or majority, but if just being open isn't enough to encourage a minority group, is it that wrong to create a separate place for them?

Some people had the view is that Ferengi women were held as slaves. My view was that Ferengi women were not treated as badly as that. As an example, Ferengi women have full responsibility for the education system. This doesn’t sound like a slave. 

Anyway, the reaction was very negative. I thought this was strange because we were discussing a fictional alien group. If someone wants to imagine the Ferengi as extreme sexists they can. But why can’t I imagine them simply as an alien group with strict gender roles?

&gt;Valerio said that although the paperwork was technically correct, the government would not ""back a union of an illegal activity that violates the fundamental rights of women and men who, because of poverty or other circumstances, give their bodies for others to abuse them.""

[...]

207,Advice needed.,"I am hoping to get some helpful advice here.  Unfortunately this is difficult to explain, and I don't want this to be taken the wrong way.

If there's one thing I've come to learn, it's how to pick up on people's body language and cues.  On some of the occasions I've been with women, their body language and gestures have very much given the impression of '*go away*', or just been really really weird or *off*, for want of a better word.  And this has led to some really bad experiences that I've had to deal with.  

These situations have occurred either when I've gone back to their house or when they came back to my house.  Then once we've been in private, their behaviour and body language just goes sideways, as I've tried to describe above.  When things have turned out this way, either I've left (when I've been at their house), or I've asked them to leave (when they've been at my house).  These situations have been really unpleasant to deal with, to say the least, but when I've had to ask them to leave my house, that's been especially bad.  I've got to make it clear that I'm not making some stupid claim that *all women are nuts*....nothing like that.  In fact it's way more often that *we guys* are the idiots - probably in about 99% of these sorts of cases.  But some women I've met have turned out to be absolute fruit loops once we get behind closed doors.

I've never said or done anything untoward, nor have I ever tried to be coercive in any way.  Never.  These situations have simply been a case of their body language turning toxic, then once I go to leave, or tell them to leave, they become rude/abusive.

I'm very much asking to get some advice in regards to this above....

Particularly in the situation where I've got someone at my house and they start behaving really weird, what should I do?  It's bad enough when this happens at their house, but when this ass hattery unfolds at my house, it's much harder to deal with.  Just what should I do?

Also, if you're out with someone at a bar, then you decide to go home together, most people would think you're both going to bed....but you can never presume this.  Would you have a proper *bedroom talk* before leaving the bar or club?  But just trying to have this sorta talk can also turn bad.  What would you do?

If someone doesn't like me, doesn't want to be with me, I'm totally fine with that.  There's been cases where I've been approached and not liked the person, so I get it.  But I want to find out in public, not have everything turn rancid once we go somewhere private.",AskFeminists,1535921967,trying-not-2-stumble,1,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/9cfhj3/advice_needed/,2018-09-02

*Full disclosure:* I'm a guy who has mixed feelings about feminism, I prefer egalitarianism but still want to learn about feminism and the associated views. 

Recently I read ^^^on ^^^reddit that feminists don't like porn. They believe it's degrading and objectifying to women, if I understand correctly. But at the same time Feminists support sex work. ^^I ^^think..? 

This seems illogical, isn't porn a form of sex work? (thus it should be supported, if sex work is good)

But isn't it also likely that men who hire women for sex work objectify them?  (which is bad)

Also though there are porn sites run by women which specifically create women on women porn. Theoretically the conditions within that organization are humane? (which seems like it would be supported by feminists, buut it's still porn..)

These seem like conflicting views.. Would one of you be kind enough to clear things up?

14,What do you think about the exclusion of men in the movement?,"I'm a guy from Chile and we have a big ''protest culture'', a girl in law school from the best university of the country made a ''Protection Resource'' which is a jurisdictional action to protect one's Human Rights because she was sexually harassed by a teacher who also used to be a minister in the constitutional court, this sparked great controversy and several universities all over the country were taken by the students asking for reforms because the guy barely got a 3 months suspension. This was called ''Toma Feminista''

In my university, this year we didnt have a general representation because of last year problems so several assemblies in which only particular careers would participate were created to vote wether we would stop having classes and protest or not, every career was different and because of pression from different careers at the end everyone stopped having classes.

I study law so we were one of the first to add to this protest and girls lead it (obviously, it was very important to add the Feminist last name to the movement) and i believe it was handled pretty well, was very democratic and several activities took place to teach about men and womens problems, students would sleep in the university (which isn't common here) and both men and women were together in this, this wasnt the case for everyone tho, other careers such as medicine, periodism, psychology, etc. didnt have any activities for men and didnt allow men at assemblies, it was hard for them to vote and they werent allow to enter some spaces which were taken by those particular careers, a friend of mine who was studing medicine wanted a room to study but wasnt allow to enter, so i had to ask for one and he studied where usually only law students are, we would vote every week if we wanted to continue and we had to fill a quorum, those careers that didnt allow men to participate quickly lost support from both men and women and had to give up their spaces sooner than others.

22,Looking for a nice mature discussion,"Hello people of r/AskFeminists. I’m here to try and listen to the other sides point of view. I personally am not a feminist as I consider myself an equalist. Yes I hear all the time about how feminism does fight for equality and what not but it mostly focuses on women. If you go through my history you will see I am fairly active on the mens rights sub, I am looking forward to a nice discussion with facts and statistics instead of it being reduced to name calling (not calling people out that’s just how the internet is sometimes). So let me start my first question with, what issues do you have with current gender equality that women have to deal with that men don’t (Also don’t do anything with biology as that can’t be fixed, so don’t say periods or child birth or anything like that I mean socially/ politically)?

23,"If feminism is for equality of the genders, why is it named after women?","As title.

I've seen many times people argue that feminism is for gender equality, and immediately I have to wonder - why is it named after *the female gender*? While I can't think of an eloquent such name, surely, if you had a movement for gender equality, you'd name it after gender equality, rather than naming it after one gender.

I accept that women *do* have areas where they have less rights than men, or problems men do not face, and that tackling these problems may bring us closer to gender equality, but if you only ever focus on one gender (as the name would imply to me), you will never reach equality - because, completely theoretically, eventually women would have had all their problems solved, but men would still have theirs.

To give similar examples - the mens' rights movement focuses on mens' rights, which again will hopefully lead us closer to equality, but alone will not do that. The black rights movement brings us closer to racial equality, but if, for example, Asians are still being discriminated against, racial equality is still absent.

I feel there's an important distinction between acting for equality of the genders (from both sides), and acting for women's rights because it will bring us closer to equality of the genders.

29,"How does feminism view ""sexy"" cosplay?","Long time lurker, first time poster, decided to make an account to ask something that's been on my mind the past week.

I went to the EVO fighting game tournament in Las Vegas the past week with my boyfriend, who is big into fighting games and that sort of thing. This was my first ""con"" experience of any sort, and one thing I noticed is that there were a lot of cosplayers there, particularly in very revealing outfits.

I know gaming, and fighting games in particular, has a big problem with oversexualized designs for the female characters, and a lot of the cosplay I saw there reflected that. Some of them had booths set up where they were selling signed photos of themselves, a lot of which looked borderline pornographic to me. Most of the people I saw lined up at the booths and taking photos with them were men, and the whole thing just really made me feel uncomfortable.

I'm feeling very conflicted. I don't think women should be told what they can and can't do with their bodies or sexual expression, but it feels to me like these women are just pandering to the male gaze. My concern is that this will just add to the problem of women being viewed only as sexual objects, and only worsen the problem with objectification in the gaming community and female character designs. I feel like this sort of thing should be discouraged, as ultimately to me it feels like it's kind of demeaning to women as a whole, but the last thing I want to do is try and police other women's sexual expression.

Mansplaining: where a person (often a man) explains something to another (often a woman) in a condescending, esp. where the other is more qualified. 

If I'm mistaken about the definition, please correct me. I seek a reply to the following:

1. Saying ""you throw like a girl"" is sexist as it assumes girls are weak and incompetent. Saying ""you're condescending like a man"" is somehow different because...? Both phrases are technically true (men interrupt more; women on average have lower upper body strength), but one is blasphemy and the other a buzzword.

2. The phrase endorses an argument from authority. So what if a woman is more qualified than a man? In a superficial sense credentials matter. But realistically, the authority of the parties is irrelevant to the quality of the argument.

3. Endorses an argument of identity; it sanctions the notion that as a man your argument may be prejudiced by default. The fact the gender of a speaker is at all relevant to the observation should be the first clue there is an issue. Thoughts?

While all the feminists I have met in real life in my own small country have been very nice, and just generally *good* people, my experience with feminists online have been very different. I recently came across an article on the washington post which really rattled me to the core: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7\_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm\_term=.3fd9020bbdd8](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3fd9020bbdd8)  


Not only does this person, who is not some crazy person on the internet but a college professor writing for the washington post, blatantly admit that she hates men, she also thinks that men shouldn't run for office or be in charge of *anything.* Now, this isn't exactly my idea of equality. This seems more like  revenge to me, and this woman wants to enact it out on an individual level. So I guess I have a few qestions: Do you agree with the article? And do you actually want to remove certain rights that men have, such as our right to run for office, our right to potentially hold a leadership position, our right to own property, perhaps? And my other question is: Why do people like the author of said article seem to be the ones with the farthest-reaching voice?

54,Roe v. Wade &amp; the Fundamental Right to Abortion,"Do you think it’s realistic that Roe v. Wade will be overturned?  I say no.

When Brett K. was announced as the new SCJ, I noticed various news articles that argued Roe v. Wade is going to be overturned.  I have not engaged anyone in this discussion, but after thinking about it a while, I started to get curious what other people thought about this subject.  I say it’s unlikely because it makes the SC look extremely political (even more so than it already is).  And it just seems unreasonable for the SC to say that a right exists as fundamental under the constitution but later on claim it is not fundamental.  All fundamental rights would be at risk, including the recent right for gay marriage.

Thoughts anybody?  And if it were to be overturned, do you think the Congress would step in, or leave it up to the states?

Without the need for males to reproduce, along with the neutralisation of the advantage males have (generally stronger/bigger) because of widespread labour-reducing technology and machines, males aren't essential or even needed. Considering the problems with society that are generally attributed to males (violence, rape, etc) an arguement develops for a female-only society.

86,Why doesn't feminism have or entertain terms for negative female behavior that mirrors negative male behavior?,"Why doesn't feminism have or entertain terms for negative female behavior that mirrors negative male behavior? 

If you frequent subs where feminist ideology is spread, terms like toxic masculinity, male gaze, mansplaining, manspreading, etc. aren't strangers to you. But what I've often wondered is why there aren't female parallels in the feminist lexicon: where is toxic femininity? Female gaze? Femnagging? Fem-puttingyourhandbagontheseatnexttoyouwhereapersonshouldsit? (that last one is a bit lengthy, admittedly, but we can work on it). In other words, why does feminism only seem to focus on the negative parts of masculinity? That was poorly worded, sorry: many of you do focus on helping men up, too... but inward criticism seems to be rather foreign to the movement. You can lift up men. You can lift up women. You can bash men... but you must never bash women, it seems. I'm just wondering why that facet is excluded from the ideology. 

First, what I mean: lets take toxic femininity. I think it'd be hard to deny that there are negative behaviors that are pretty much exclusive to women, and further ones that exist in the absence of male influence. For instance, the movie Mean Girls, even if changed to ""Mean Boys,"" probably wouldn't have made the cut with an all male cast; the secrets, the backstabbing, the shaming, and the vindictive cruelty that sometimes infects female on female interaction simply isn't usually a male trait. ""Mean Boys"" would've been a hard sell unless it was just an hour and a half of high school jocks kicking the shit out of one another. The kind of femininity demonstrated in Mean Girls, and in many real life interactions, is nothing if not toxic, yet it doesn't get a special label. Why? 

For another, mansplaining is a thing. It's been demonstrated that women get talked over. Yet there's also a form of conversation that women dominate, as any taken man, particularly the married ones, could tell you: telling a man to do shit, or asking why he hasn't yet. The case isn't generally that women are just sitting in the recliner with a beer trying to enjoy the game and the man storms in to ask why she hasn't cleaned the rain gutters yet, or why she doesn't put her shoes away, or why she hasn't taken him on that date he has always been promising to the Botanical Gardens. Men might dominate the ""I know this shit"" realm of lecturing other human beings, but women dominate the ""you should do this shit"" realm of lecturing. Yet it doesn't get a special label. Why? 

Another might be mansplaining. This one straightforward: there's a whole term for a man spreading his legs too wide (it's because of our nuts, ladies), yet none exists for a woman putting her handbag on the seat next to her on the bus. Why? 

Finally, why no ""female gaze?"" You ever watch MI2? That scene where Cruise slips while free climbing up a sheer rock face for no apparent reason and clings, sweaty and panting, to the cliff with his muscles rippling and sweaty? You can't tell me that was for men. Or in Spartacus: lots of T&amp;A in that series, but half the fucking show was jacked, attractive dudes dueling in slow motion while wearing loincloths, loincloths which they'd often drop at the request of their female admirers, giving the audience nice, panning views of glutes as big as my head. That wasn't for the benefit of males. What of, like, every romance novel ever written (consumed like 95% by women), where rich, dark, swarthy, tall, chiseled, rich Fabio seem to only fucking exist to wrestle alligators on his six-pack in defense of the female protagonist, so he can rise up the victor, glistening and dripping, to carry her off, bodice-ripping-style, to his mansion for a session of passionate, attentive love making? What of, like, every chick flic ever made where the (sometimes multiple) male love interests are always depicted as attractive jocks who always seem to be cooking something as they listen to her talk about her day and support her? I could go on, but the point is that females have their gaze, too. They have things they like to read and see and play. So why is there a term designed to demonize and shame men for reading, seeing, and playing in a reality that they like, but not one for women? 

TL;DR on those first four: for ever term detailing a negative aspect of hyper-masculinity, there's a complimentary term that should exist for hyper-femininity. 

Now, why should you care, you say? Feminism is a movement designed to better and uplift women, so why would we want to bash aspects of femininity, you ask? Well precisely for that reason: feminism is supposed to be uplifting women, and, say, toxic femininity is as much the bane of that goal as toxic masculinity is. What's that saying? Something about not being concerned with the splinter in your neighbors eye when you've got a log in your own? Feminism has done a lot of great things, but their ability to be introspectively critical isn't one of them. Women aren't some perfect thing above reproach: some men ramble too much, yes, some men sit with their legs as spread as their hips will allow, yes, some men aspire to be so masculine it's bad, yes, but women have inherent negative aspects, too. Why aren't these mentioned? Did you know, for instance, that most studies have found that women are just as if not more likely to slut shame other women compared to how much men do the same? If your goal is to eliminate shaming for sexual behavior, then, you need to be addressing toxic femininity first: it's the bigger fish you have to fry - if you have any time to spare, then you should deal with toxic masculinity. 

And just as a somewhat related side rant, I'm also rather tired of the root of every problem being traceable back to men. It seems to imply that there's nothing that women could do that's possibly wrong, so therefore if something is wrong the fault must lie with men. For instance, I was just in a discussion with one of your subscribers about the unrealistic depiction of men and women in video games. My detractor concluded that the reason women are often over-sexualized in video games was due to the male gaze... and the reason the men were hyper-masculine was due to toxic masculinity. Now, if she said the former was due to the male gaze and the latter was due to toxic femininity (given that most all of the male characters in question were specifically hyper-masculine because that's what men admire because that's the kind of man women want) I'd have had no issue. But she, like many other feminists, seems adverse to placing any blame on a woman's doorstep; if there's something wrong with men, the problem is men; if there's something wrong with women, the problem is men. It smells like bullshit to me. 

Maybe this seems petty, but one of my huge qualms with the various side facets of feminism (not the ""women should be equal bit - we all fucking agree on that) is their habit of placing all the blame on men when it's obvious that some of these problems are inherent to women and femininity. You don't fucking blame the Muslims for problems inherent to Christianity, you just own up to those faults and do your best to fix them... yet feminism, at least when one judges its terminology, seems unwilling or unable to do this. And if your goal is to ""advance women,"" but any negative aspect of women or femininity is out of bounds, you'll never fully achieve that goal. You need to own up to the fact your own shit stinks, too, before calling out the smell of other shit will gain any traction. And FWIW, you'd be that much closer to gaining back people like me, who consider themselves ""core feminists"" in the sense that believe in the goal but not all your crazy methods and side-tracked, hyper-intellectualized nonsense, into the fold.

96,When can targeting a certain sex really be sexism?,"Hi all,

I'm coming with a more controversial issue. A recent r/worldnews [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/96n7r5/uk_male_university_professors_to_be_given_reverse/) links to an article about how male university professors in some places would be assigned mentors, these mentors will either be female or of a ""minority group"". These mentors are supposed to be able to counteract whatever ""unconscious bias"" there is. There are several reactions to this, but I think the most important are as follows:

* Being assigned a mentor by default is an assumption, in this case the assumption is that being white and male means that you are not properly educated on sexism and diversity issues
* Being assigned a mentor is taken to be a negative from the offset, perhaps even demeaning, hence the white male members of faculty are being mistreated in some way
* The mentors don't have to undergo any training, simply the fact of being who they are is sufficient to be a mentor.
* It can perhaps show the assumption that female (or minority) members of faculty are free from any relevant bias.
* The evidence that countering unconscious biases in this way is lacking in the first place.

So my issue  is, with consideration of these factors, can the policy be considered sexist, or racist? Why or why not? My gut reaction is to say 'no' however from searching around on this sub there seems to be some split between people who think that sexism can only exist, in our society, against women (and that anything else is ""merely"" discrimination or prejudice) and those who think that sexism is any discrimination along the lines of sex.

Further, where does this begin and end? Are gender segregated sports teams (counting trans people as the gender they wish to present as) sexist, for instance? Is affirmative action sexist, in that it might deny otherwise qualified applicants in favour of those less qualified?

I'd also be interested in learning some of the academic definitions of sexism and literature on it, and how its specificity to predominantly counting female victims of sexism is justified - as in, why should the structure of society be taken into account when discussing sexism?

100,Do men get as attacked as much as women do about their looks or are silent about being harassed?,"So context, I thought I would have some fun and post on rateme sub. I knew what I was signing up for when it came to the roast comments. I ended up having a good laugh and knew that it was all in good fun. While I’m no supermodel I have a healthy amount of confidence in myself and knew not to take it seriously. I up’d all of the roast comments and replied if it made me laugh. But what I didn’t know about was the dms. Most of the dms were just trying to hmu but there were a few throwaway accounts. I saw horrible comments (racist, the classic kys, walls upon walls of random vile words to add edgy favor, and so on.) It was a 14 year old on Xbox live level of insults. One even claimed to find my ip to track me down because I kept saying lmao to all his lackluster insults. I just screenshot the conversations to share some laughs with my friends and blocked. I ended up removing my picture to avoid these people blowing up my dms, but kept the comments for fun. I shared this story with friends and I was very surprised how many went through almost the exact same  thing on that and other subreddits. There’s a difference in being called ugly and people threatening to come murder you for have confidence in yourself. What I’m asking is have men experienced this level of harassment? Have women/other men blow your dms up and spammed you all night with random vile vocabulary to try (and failed) to upset you? I didn’t want to make a claim without hearing some testimonies.

103,"Some questions about consent,flirting and remarks","So i have a few questions the first 1 being about flirting cause i read an article about men being scared to flirt/talk to women on their job because they are afraid of being called molesters or something. i read this and thought of course you can flirt to women however when you do this and she doesnt responds or says something about not liking it you should let it go , so my question how do you think about it and where do you draw the line i mean trying to kiss someone on work is going to far but by talking/flirting where do you draw the line?

The second question i have is about consent,
So lets picture 2 situtation 1 where you had 3 dates with a women and you go to her or your place and watch a movie then you try to kiss here, in my opinion this would be fine as long as you dont try to force it if she like turns hur face or something so hwo do you think about this situation?

Situtation 2 you are at a club and are dancing with this girl and start dancing is a nice way like close to eachother and you try to kiss her. do you think this is a no go and why ? personnally i think it depends on the situation but a lot of women in clubs dont care about men trying that in the club as long as they dont force it.

my third topic is remarks

So im at work or at friends or just chatting in a group with my friends and someone sends a picture of like a good looking famous women or something and 1 of my friends says something like damm i would do her in an instant , is this bad? because there are no women in the group she will never get to read or hear it.",AskFeminists,1534150304,Ewhore69,9,10,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/96wph2/some_questions_about_consentflirting_and_remarks/,2018-08-13

129,What do feminists make of the comparatively low support for feminism/identification as a feminist?,"Hi all, 

I've spent some time trawling through reoccurring posts and I don't believe this topic has come up, or at least not often. I also re-reviewed your rules before posting, and hope this won't rub anyone the wrong way. I can't promise a change of view, but I would enjoy a feminist take on this topic and I *can* promise to be open minded about what you have to say. 

I'm wondering what feminists make of the fact that while most people agree with statements like ""I believe in equality for women,"" only some varying fraction of those people actually identify as feminists. 

Some examples:

[Pew Study](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/19/many-around-the-world-say-womens-equality-is-very-important/) (focuses on gender equality, not feminism)

[Telegraph poll](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/only-7-per-cent-of-britons-consider-themselves-feminists/) (UK specific)

[WP poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/feminism-project/poll/?noredirect=on)

[Vox poll](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3570070/Vox_Poll_Toplines__2_.0.pdf) (Feminist questions start at question 63)

[PBS column](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-why-millennial-women-dont-want-to-call-themselves-feminists)

There are many and more examples of this trend, and the stats vary quite a bit. Generally, ""support for equality"" ranges around 80-90+%, while feminist identification hovers somewhere between single digits and a third of the population. Whatever numbers you choose, it seems like support for equality is *always* higher than support for feminism, and by quite large amounts, too. Also worth noting that there are sizable percentages of people who go so far as to state that they are ***not*** feminists, as opposed to just not having an opinion on the subject, and a smaller portion who identify as actively against feminism. Combined, these groups are far too large to account for the \~10-20% of people who don't support gender equality: there must, therefore, be non-feminists and anti-feminists in the ""I support gender equality,"" group. In fact, combined, it seems they actually account for *more* of the ""I support gender equality"" group than feminists do. 

Seeing as how it's quite arguable that *the* core tenet of feminism is gender/sex equality, it is odd that so few people who agree with that tenet actively choose not to identify as feminists, and, indeed, may choose to actively resist feminism. I'm wondering what feminists make of these facts and trends. 

I've only had occasion to discuss this subject with one feminist prior to this. I floated the opinion that perhaps the large subset of other, tangential ideas and causes that feminism has occupied itself with in recent years is the reason for this lack of support. I floated that idea since it's the case for me personally: at best I'd consider myself a ""core feminist,"" in that I believe in the central ideological pillar of feminism, but tend to not care about/disagree with/downright dislike many of the other ideological facets of feminism, and have been treated quite poorly by feminists both online and in real life, which, while anecdotal for sure, also puts me off of their movement. She countered that the real reason was more likely poor representation in the media or by other detractors, that large swaths of the population ""just don't get"" feminism, and that perhaps modern people see feminism as too cliche or passe to occupy themselves with. I conceded that those are all probably valid factors, too, but didn't change my original stance that there are some aspects of third wave feminism that people understand well enough, but just dislike, causing them to continue supporting gender equality but ditch the feminist label. 

But that was just me and one feminist discussing the topic on a post that wasn't even about the subject. I'd be curious what a whole sub of feminists dedicated to answering such questions would have to say on the matter.

Perhaps more a more on point example was the Women's March back in 2017.  The march removed at least two ""feminist"" organizations from their list of partners after learning that they were pro-life.  Presumably, these organizations did otherwise believe in equality between the genders (New Wave Feminists, for example, appear to believe that abortion is a symptom of broader oppression), but did not support abortion and so were unwelcome.

150,Feminist MRA?,"Hello everyone,

I've been thinking about a project and am looking for advice and thoughts. It's called Feminist MRA.

Basically, it would be an exploration of Men's Rights Issues but with a feminist lens. I'm hoping to look at the issues that concern the MRA movement (suicide, incarceration rates, parental rights, toxic masculinity, male sexual abuse, rape, the differences between men and women, etc.) but without all the hate that usually gets mixed in with those messages. I want to explore this world with men and women being equal as a starting point and talk about these ideas without any anger or misogyny.

My goal would be to provide an alternative to the world of The Red Pill and Men's Rights and all the other poisonous forums out there. Because right now, if a young man starts to explore these ideas he will find his way to places like that and easily be seduced by the 'actually, YOU are the victim' and 'it's feminisms fault' messages to be found there. Those forums often start out with an ernest message about high male suicide rate but slowly hook the reader into an ideology of hate.

So that's what I am looking for advice on. What do you think? Do you know of something already existing that I could contribute to? Am I missing some key element in my idea that would let it become toxic or otherwise subverted? What do you think of the title? I was trying to find something provocative in order to cut through all the noise. I know that MRA is a word many associate with the absolute worst kind of fucker. I'd like to subvert that.

In case you're curious about my point of view. I'm a straight white male who works in construction and loves the UFC. I like to think that I might be in a position to reach other men who are exploring their ideas. I am married to a strong woman and am a father. I try to be the best feminist that a boy raised in the 80's can be. I believe strongly in the power of love and redemption.

Any advice or suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

Much peace to all.

151,What happened to women in computer science during the 1980s?,"Computer science was always male dominated, but before around 1985ish there seemed to be a lot more women studying computer science than there is today.

It seems like something in the 1980s happened which made computer science a more hostile environment for women to work in. I studied computer science for about 18 months and could count the number of women studying computer science on two hands.

I've tried searching around for an explanation for this. It seems like the general consensus is the gaming community (marketed primarily towards men) is the reason for this. I agree that's a contributing factor, however, I feel like there's more to the story. There's so much more to computer science than just gaming. Can the gaming industy alone really impact the number of women studying computer science that much? Surely I'm missing something else.

The other thing I noticed - and I'm not sure how to put this politely - but I noticed that the majority of men doing computer science are very anti-social, awkward in general, and just don't know how to act appropriately or interact with other people. Could gaming alone possibly be the reason for this specific demographic of people studying computer science?

I should also point out that I'm 20 so I wasn't alive to witness this happening myself and therefore lack a lot of historical context with respect to the 80s.",AskFeminists,1534401325,Jragon014,15,29,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/97pxqx/what_happened_to_women_in_computer_science_during/,2018-08-16

157,"Under Patriarchy, Can it Be Considered That There is A ""Marginalised Gender?""","In keeping with the basic theme that [traditional gender roles are related to the suffering of men and women who are forced to conform](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntersecHumanism/comments/969g6i/what_are_intersectionalhumanist_ih_systems_of/) (where the focus in feminist communities is on women's issues), I am trying to find out whether we can consider there to be such a thing as a marginalised gender as a result of this, when we consider the issues faced:

Female specific issues that are commonly cited:

* higher rates of sexual harassment victims
* lower overall pay rates
* lower representation at the top echelons of society
* plenty of other topics (dealing with chauvinist attitudes, cat-calling, sexual commodification, etc.).

Male specific issues that are also commonly cited (and often addressed by feminists):

* higher rates of violent assault victims
* higher likelihood of working dangerous, menial labour-type jobs
* high likelihood of being conscripted and dying in the military
* plenty of other topics (dealing with higher rates of incarceration, prison rape, not allowed to show emotional vulnerability, etc.).

175,How do you keep your chin up with all this?,"I’ve gone down a bit of a rabbit hole the past few days and I feel like crap. 

Long story short: I was banned from r/Feminism the other day, and it really got me down, but I think it was useful. Amber Rose tweeted something like, “50 men call 1 woman a hoe and she gets dragged; 50 women call 1 man a rapist and no one believes them.” I posted something approximate to - shouldn’t rape be treated with more scrutiny—ie, a trial—given that it’s an accusation of a violent crime?

I was banned, and told off by the mods. At first I was intensely discouraged. I’m a woman and identify as a feminist, but am sometimes uncomfortable with statements I see feminists making about men. I see a lot of shades of grey, but have fewer and fewer spaces in which to hash things out with people. Among the people I know personally, I fear saying the wrong thing and being labeled a bad person. I feel weirdly closeted, and unable to have honest conversations with people. So my elimination from the Feminism board made me cry a wee bit, because for gods sake I don’t have many places left to speak and I’m tired of feeling so confused. 

Then I did some fucking research. 

Estimates are rough, but around 1 in 7 women have been raped. 

Around 7%, MAYBE, of rape accusations are false. 

Rape is a freaking huge societal problem. False accusation can destroy Iives, but it doesn’t occur on anywhere near the scale of rape. 

And yet about a million of the posts on this board are people asking variations on the question, “But what about the issue of false accusation?”

Which to me, begs the question: What the fuck about rape, guys? Do you even fucking care?

I’m sad to have lost access to r/Feminism and I think it was a bit reactive. But then again, no wonder they banned me. 

In one sense, this is all fascinating. But for some reason this is hitting me really hard and I’ve kind of been crying all day. I want to be a good ally. I want to have the fortitude to educate myself and have the fights I need to have. But sometimes I have revelations like this and it really gets me down. I don’t feel secure being a feminist activist in my daily life, because I’m so scared of being labeled a bad feminist. But I want to be. But I’m also so fucking tired. And every time I participate it feels like I step on a landmine. But then there are land mines inherent to being a woman, and be have to fight all the time to even be believed. 

How the fuck do you all educate yourselves and others while also taking care of yourselves? How can I be a good feminist when all I really wanna do is focus on my career and living my small life? Am I a shitty person? I’m not even quite sure what I’m asking but man am I having a weird day. Sorry for the rant and thanks for any solidarity.

180,What's the connection between anarchism/communism and feminism?,"I've spent a decent amount of time on 2XC and r/feminism, but only after being introduced to this sub did I see so many pro-anarchism/communism flairs, posts, and comments. Despite studying feminism both in school and in my free time I never really associated those ideologies with one another. Is this some facet of feminism I completely missed, or is this more a sub-specific culture that I stumbled into? 

I'm aware that the status of the average woman in, say, Communist Russia or China, was bolstered somewhat along with the men. ""A rising tide lifts all boats"" kind of thing. And besides, the Party needed all working hands on deck, so it made sense to employ women for the betterment of the party. But this begs a follow up question: why tie the empowerment of your sex to the mast of a sinking ship? Geez that's a lot of nautical phrasing. Sorry about that. But anyways, okay, great, communist societies sometimes boosted the status of women for a while off and on before becoming repressive hellholes and then collapsing or having to shift to other forms of government to survive. Out of the couple dozen attempts at communism none has ever been successful, and none collapsed gracefully (i.e. without killing off oftentimes quite large swaths of their own citizens in either deliberate purges or through incompetence). It just seems like an odd wagon to hitch your feminist horse to (just for a change of idioms), given that the horse has, historically speaking, run off a cliff ten times out of ten, killing its passengers or leaving them worse for the wear. 

Especially odd since at the same time that women were being granted modicums of liberation by communist governments, feminists in non-communist capitalist democracies were making such great advancements, as they continue to do today. In other words, there doesn't seem to be any reason apparent to me that a communist society is required to advance equality and women's rights. Its been done and is being done in capitalist democracies, with the added benefit of happening in a system that actually works and can live longer than your grandpa. 

Similar thoughts on anarchism: beyond small zones and isolated communes, anarchism is largely a fantasy utopia. It's never been proven to work on any kind of large scale (like, say, 350,000,000 people in the US), and even in the places it does work it's often not even pure anarchism. It's basically a social experiment at this point... which is all fine and well, but again, kind of odd to see so many people hitching their wagon to an unproven, hypothetical horse when we have (and many of us live in) a proven, functional system for implementing the kind of changes they want to see. 

TL;DR: the status of women in capitalist democracies has gotten better and better pretty much every decade for hundreds of years at this point. Given this, it seems kind of odd to want to abandon that vehicle in favor for one that is proven not to work or one that is still in the early beta stages and may or may not work (and by work I don't even mean successfully deliver gender equality...

189,Is Feminism more Important than Marxism?,"Simply put: the wealthiest 85 individuals on the planet own more than the poorest 50% of all of humanity. The fact that most of them are men is interesting, but says nothing for the vast number of poverty stricken or working-class men in the world!  


Whether or not there are privileges afforded to working-class men over working-class women (in our Western countries) is hotly debated. Let's assume it's all true: the pay-gap, the glass-ceiling, patriarchy, everything. Surely it is true that the privileges afforded to a woman born (or married) into a billionaire's family vastly outstrip anything afforded to a typical working-class male?\*  


\*\[Not that she wouldn't face her own unique challenges and sufferings in life, as we all do.\]  


If the issue is stripping away unjust privilege: why not go for the elephant in the room? The super-rich (regardless of their gender/sex).   


If the real issue is empowering women (and men alike): surely the best root to that empowerment is through a more generalised redistribution of wealth: not from men to women, but from rich to poor! To take from those wealthiest 85 and redistribute that money to the poorest men and women in the world equally could do a great deal for the poorest women in the world very very quickly!  


So, tell me: why dedicate one's political energy on this supposed battle between working-class men and women, when we could both get together and go after the ""capitalist elites""?  


Is there some argument that establishing gender equality is a necessary step in dismantling capitalism perhaps?

204,Thoughts on outward appearance as it pertains to social and sexual interaction.,"I rant, so:

**Short version:**

Are feminists generally supportive of the idea that they can or should be able to shirk social norms (long hair, makeup, femininity) without consequence?

**Long version:**

Every so often I'll come across ""women do not have to:"" meme, post, rant, or article raging against female beauty standards or societal expectations. The most recent one I saw included things like being thin, having long hair, being feminine, wearing makeup, shaving, and being fashionable. It also listed some stuff like having to cook or have sex with ""you"" (presumably men who enforce these standards?). I agree with items like the latter two, and to some extent all the former ones, too: you don't *have* to do anything, really. I mean, short of something like breaking the law you don't *have* to do all that much. But what struck me about this last time I saw such a listing on r/feminism wasn't that many of the commentors agreed with the sentiment of the list, it was that they followed it up with what was basically a ""yeah, and it shouldn't have any impact on my social or sexual interactions, either!""

This I found odd. Just personally speaking, I take pride in my appearance. I cut my own hair weekly and style it to look sharp, professional, and fashionable every day. I maintain my facial hair: wax and oil in the beard, and smooth where I don't want hair. I won't go into too much detail here but that's not the only hair I maintain, either. I have an ever expanding wardrobe of good looking, high quality clothing, and I take care when choosing what I wear to ensure it's flattering and coordinated. I accessorize in the form of many belts, watches, shoes, wallets, and glasses/sunglasses. I use various lotions and exfoliators to keep my skin healthy. I work out regularly not just to maintain my health but to make sure I look good and fit. I've even worked on other ways I present myself: I speak deeply, clearly, and confidently; I give firm handshakes with solid eye contact; when I walk I'm sure-footed and purposeful about it; I keep good posture, standing or sitting; I practice smiling and other facial modulations. 

To some extent I do these things because I personally enjoy looking good. It pleases me when I look in the mirror and like what I see. But I'd be kidding myself if I said it was ""just"" for me. Humans are largely visual animals, and the first thing people judge you on is your appearance, and that's a huge factor in why I maintain my appearance as I do. Friends, family, coworkers, bosses, clients, strangers, and perhaps *especially* sexual prospects will notice how I look and judge me for it, and I can make their judgement more favorable, or even admiring, by putting effort into my presentation. I like it when people tell me I look good, or that I know how to make an entrance, or that they can tell I've been working out, or that I have the voice of a news anchor or a talk radio host. These are all things I've worked on, and I'm proud of them. They take work, practice, and experimentation to maintain and develop, but they're well worth the social (and sexual) benefits. 

What I gleaned from the commentors over at r/feminism is that this ""effort = benefit"" system shouldn't exist. That I shouldn't suffer any negative outcomes if I show up to a job interview in a ratty old shirt with sneakers I should've thrown out five years ago. That my sexual prospects shouldn't be diminished if I choose not to maintain my hair and don't exercise. I know that feminism concerns itself with deconstructing certain social norms, but is this really the extent of it? 

Again, I'm in full agreement that nobody should ""have"" to do anything... but shirking social expectations comes with social consequences, does it not? And how and why would it be any other way?

215,Thoughts on Revolutionary Girl Utena? (And other Ikuhara anime),"I used the search bar to try and find if there had been anything posted about Utena and was kinda shocked that it hadn't been discussed here, so I thought I'd make a post about it!  


For those of you haven't heard of it, *Revolutionary Girl Utena* is an anime created by Kunihiko Ikuhara (the guy who directed a majority of the Sailor Moon anime and is credited with making it the success that it was) about a teenage girl named Utena who met a Prince as a child, and vows to herself to find said Prince again one day and to become a Prince herself in the meantime. On her journey to find her Prince she enrolls in school called Ohtori Academy, where she comes across an group of Duelists who are fighting for ownership the Rose Bride, a girl named Anthy. Utena accidentally wins Anthy in a duel and then promises to protect her from the other Duelists. Throughout the series, there's a very large amount of time put into discussing various aspects of gender like toxic masculinity, misogyny, homophobia, sexual assault, puberty and a few other things I'm forgetting off the top of my head.  


The series has been praised as being *the* lesbian, feminist anime for its commentary on gender, gender roles and sexuality. Ikuhara has especially gained praise because his anime tend to have a very strong criticism of society and social constructs (the anime he later went on to make, *Mawaru Penguindrum* and *Yuri Kuma Arashi*, are both a social commentary on capitalism and heteronormativity, respectively.) All of his series are very wonderfully made stories with very great social commentary (although they can be a little confusing lol,) and I totally recommend checking them out if you haven't yet! (Oh but just a warning, things like sexual assault and violence come up a lot due to the nature of the things his series are about.)

Like I said, I hadn't seen any posts about any of his works here so I thought it might be interesting to ask about it as I just rewatched RGU and YKA earlier this week lol. Have any of you seen any of his works? What did you think of them?",AskFeminists,1534718532,NSFDoubleBlue,7,8,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/98oao7/thoughts_on_revolutionary_girl_utena_and_other/,2018-08-19
216,"The show Riverdale chose to exclude the Betty-Archie-Veronica love triangle to support feminism.

For those of you who don't know, the Archie comics were based on two girls, Betty and Veronica, fighting over this guy Archie. Riverdale is a show adapted from the comics, but it had barely any of this love triangle. From the article, an actress in the show said, "" It would have been very problematic — when we’re in the middle of this very progressive, feminist movement where positive changes are happening — to encourage that kind of relationship on a show that targets young women."" 

To me, this feels silly and pointless. Actress Lili Reinhart said that ""Betty is not as much of a pushover — she’s not some girl who fawns over Archie and lets him walk all over her, which is basically what happened for 75 years. I love that the show doesn’t just go on the easy path of having these girls constantly battle for Archie’s affections"", but I think love triangles are a real thing and they are not oppressing any gender by doing this. It is true that most teens, when  romantically attracted to someone, let that person walk all over them regardless of gender. That's just how it is, so showing this in a TV show wouldn't not be empowering to anyone.

4,Do you feel that Transwomen should be protected/accepted into the feminist community?,"I am saying this because I saw an Instagram post today which said ""you're not a feminist unless you support all females (and then listed minorities e.g Muslims Women, Black Women) ect. One of the listed minorities is ""transwomen"" and I thought this was quite strange. (I come from an area where there's not many trans people and diversity.) 

Why do some feminists feel the urge to support transwomen? Do you feel it devalues being ""female"" when someone, who was formally male, dresses up in ""feminine clothes"", acts feminine, and sometimes surgically alters their sexual region to have a vagina? Isn't being a woman more than being feminine and having a vagina between your legs?
 
In addition to this, should we accept transwomen into female bathrooms? Women's bathrooms are supposed to be a safe place for women. Do you feel that someone who is a trans woman should be allowed to use the same toliets, considering toliets have been locations for numerous amounts of rapes?

14,Why can't we combine feminism and the MRM into one movement? please read the description,"Yes, I know this is asked frequently. Yes, I have checked the sidebar. Yes, I have read the past posts about this topic. I made this post to ask about your responses to those previous posts.

After reading some old threads, I was able to find three reasons we can't do this.

1. Feminism is to egalitarianism as Black Lives Matter is to All Lives Matter. Of course we should have gender equality, of course all lives matter. But including everyone in the picture takes away the focus from the oppressed group.
2. Egalitarianism is too vague and doesn't do anything.
3. It wouldn't work because half of the movement would believe women are oppressed, while the other half would believe men are oppressed.

My response to that is:

1. What exactly is the ""oppressed"" group? There's a lot of disagreement on this. Feminists say it's women, so they only fight for women's rights. MRM says it's men, so they only fight for men's rights. However, I think it's not so black and white. Each sex is oppressed in certain aspects of their life, and other things, such as class and race can play a role. But both movements, by definition, only fight for their respective sex's rights.
2. That could change if it gained more members. Egalitarianism is just a movement that fights for equality. The problem with feminism/MRM is that if they want to see change, they need to get everyone on the same page. But then people look at the extreme ones and say, ""I am not part of this movement because it only has misogynists/misandrists."" Then those radical people hide behind the shield of their movement and say, ""what are you talking about? I am part of this movement that fights for equality. You are not a part of this, therefore you are sexist."" Thus both movements get labeled as sexist. This problem would be solved if we combined them. Let's admit it, there are some misogynistic MRAs and there are some misandristic feminists. But by making a movement that simply fights for equality, we are making this for everyone. Those sexist people would still exist in this new movement, but people on the outside can no longer accuse the entire movement of being sexist towards a certain sex. Feminism is still doing stuff to help, like I'm sure #metoo as helped women, so if they moved to egalitarianism, they would continue doing that stuff, just under a new name. And, as a bonus, they would be stronger with the added support of MRAs. And vice versa.
3. The LGBT movement has different people- some gay, some trans, etc., yet they are all part of the same movement and fight for the same goals. The new group that forms as a result of the combination of feminism and MRM can be like this- everyone can have their own beliefs about who is oppressed, but in the end everyone will fight for everyone's rights.

This is specific to Canada and it’s based on data from Statistics Canada, a government agency. **17% of claims are deemed “unfounded.”** This isn’t the same as “unproven.” It’s when officers determine, through investigation, the offence simply didn’t occur. This 14% is *much* higher than the 2-5% often cited by feminists *and* it’s **double** the national average for other offences.

Two questions:

(1) why do feminists continue to push the false and misleading 2-5% rate?

(2) why are sexual assault claims “unfounded” **twice as much** as other offences?

22,Hi AskFeminists! I have some questions.,"So, here's the thing. I'm normally from the side that says ""Feminists are The Big Bad""; I used to be a militant MRA before I realized I was turning into exactly what I was railing against: an extremist. I've since managed to deprogram myself from much of it (it was about 4-5 years ago), but I'm always interested in opening my mind a little more. I've also found that even if I disagree with most of a person's argument there's sometimes that little nugget of gold in there that helps change my view to a more logical or empathetic place. 

So with that in mind, I'd like to start a general discussion with a few specifics areas to focus on:

\- Family law. I'm a gay man, so this entire topic is alien to me; all I know about it is what I've heard from the MRA side, which is basically ""men always get completely trashed"". What's wrong, oversimplified, deceptive etc. about that point of view?

\- What exactly is ""the patriarchy""? I've been sitting here wracking my brain for a good five minutes trying to think of how to word my understanding of it, but all I can come up with is ""a system of keeping women subjugated"" which I think is a little much and probably inaccurate.

\- I understand toxic masculinity and how that specific phrasing is widely (and wilfully) misinterpreted, but I'd really like to hear what it is straight from the mouths of people who are more educated than the average MRA about it. They just kinda tend to scream ""THEY'RE SAYING MASCULINITY IS TOXIC!"" and leave it at that. So, what exactly is it and how does it exhibit itself on both micro and macro scales?

I'd say those three topics are enough. Hell, one at a time might be too much; they're pretty general.

28,Living with my (very) sexually active ex,"Hi everyone,

I’ve lived with my girlfriend for five years now, and while she has been the love of my life, we’ve recently decided to call it quits. This has not been an easy transition to make, and the situation is made only worse by our having to live together for the next month. However we’ve agreed to remain caring and friendly with one another. No one is angry. Just sad.

Threatening this civility however is the fact that, within days of our splitting up, she’s gone on somewhat of a sexual sprint. Over the course of the last two weeks she’s been on dates with four different people, all of whom she slept with a few hours after meeting. I know this because she tells me after she gets home at 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning. It’s impossible to pretend anything else is going on.

My question is: am I wrong for thinking this is somewhat mean or callous behavior? She’s obviously free to do with her body as she pleases, but is there not something to be said for sparing a persons feelings? Especially when you say you want to remain friends? I tried communicating my concern to her, but her response was that this is a “personal problem”, and that I have no right to weigh in on her (very new) sex life. Even if it’s just until I can move in a few weeks. She also accused me of slut shaming.

How do I make it through this extremely painful period without being resentful or overstepping my bounds?

31,A bunch of questions from a fellow confused young feminist about a boy in my life,"Adam
	Every time I spend with him, I get angry. It is not angry in the moment; it is retrospective angry in the moment— if you can believe it. Like when your thoughts are ahead of your words while speaking, this kind of angry is pretty much the other way around: his words are a step ahead of my thoughts. It does not give me time to sense emotions when I want to because of the way I am choosing to think maybe because of internalized misogyny. To receive a message, you must have the context within. I try to read into his words, when he has not done the same. It is like domestic and emotional labor all in one package that has not arrived yet but is currently being tracked. I am his stenographer, editor, and public relations trying to to censor the misogyny, defensive masculinity, cis-sexism, classism, and elitism while he is live on the airwaves. But he is not speaking to the masses, he is speaking just to me. I cannot tell if it is better or worse to imagine he is speaking to a live crowd or just me. But because he scares me in a nonviolent way, I choose to imagine he is speaking to the studio audience. However, the stakes are higher if he’s releasing his repugnant and unthought words to the world because I often value the safety of others over my own safety. Although I say he scares me in a nonviolent way, that is an unimaginative way of speaking. While I choose to think of myself representing the masses to which he is lecturing, I also choose not to think that he is speaking as a representative of the traditional society of misogynistic patriarchs. Although Adam alone represents a dumb boy who mindlessly rambles without consequence to himself, Adam (you know, friends with Eve?) is the OG patriarchal representative who speaks on the policies being enforced as though they are already voted into law.
	It is poignant that I choose to think of myself as a community and him as an individual because it speaks to my fears and familiarities. First, I choose to think in a community because I want to protect others from what his words represent. I think that is a powerful paradox of patriarchal trickery: having people believing that feminism requires concern for others before concern for oneself prompted by callout culture?. That is not to say that feminists should ignore others; it just means that one must protect oneself first in order to protect others. Moreover, I choose to think of myself in a community because although I do not fit in every circle of feminism I have been benefited and protected by it as a white, upper-middle-class, cisgendered woman. I secondly choose to think of him as an individual because the very real and pervasive idea that each individual perpetuating misogynistic thoughts is a core mechanism of patriarchy has underlying consequences that are terrifying, violent, and unfathomable to me. Imagination is based in what you have already experienced. However, if I take his words as patriarchal incarnate, am I giving him too much credit for messages he might not intend?

TL;DR: I am a confused feminist and do not know whether I should assume if the words a guy is saying are intentionally misogynistic.

On the other hand it could be argued that even on that first date, even if we are in a quaint little dark hipster coffee shop with beards and tattoos everywhere, where the girl feels safe, the moment I utter the word ""king"" hordes of generations of patriarchal soldiers are lined up with metaphorical swords at her throat ""forcing"" her to agree despite her intention.

She believes that since he agreed to be the breadwinner so that she could be a stay at home mom (they don’t have any kids yet, and are not TTC) half of his income is hers. He does provide for her financially, but he gives a generous donation of 10% of his income to his church for tithing and she thinks he should only pay half because half of his income is hers. She claims that feminists would agree that he should owe her 50% of everything because she stays home and does laundry and cleans the house. I personally can’t imagine feeling entitled to anyone else’s hard earned money. I am also a stay at home mom and my husband does support our two children (one of which is from my first marriage) and myself. I view his contributions as a gift and a choice and not an obligation.

59,Help me indoctrinate my coworker?,"Title is a joke, obviously. 

But seriously, though: I have a coworker that I work very closely with. He's not from this country, and something about his attitudes and the things he's said in the past have made it seem like maybe he is not particularly feminist and might actually hold some pretty toxic attitudes about women and gender in general from where he grew up. 

Lately though, we've gotten to talking about feminist-type things (I'm not shy about my beliefs) and he's expressed a certain amount of curiosity about it and even would be open to learning more about some of the feminism basics. I'm hesitant to recommend books because i think he prefers to read them in his own language, but he does speak very good English so I think he might be amenable to some good articles/comics/videos -- basically, web content.

So I'm curious? What's your favorite online feminist content? 

This whole conversation started because he didn't know what mansplaining was, so I'm planning on linking to Rebecca Solnit's [article](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rebecca-solnit/men-explain-things-to-me-_b_1811096.html). Also the consent tea video, and...maybe the emotional load comic?

65,What feminism means to me ...,"I want to tell you all a little about myself and my question is if this is a common experience. I often feel really alone in how I feel.

I have always been a shy, sensitive man and it seemed to cause me nothing but problems growing up. I got bullied a lot in school for zoning out when boys started putting on the whole macho act. All my life I have been given 'advice' from men and women on the way a man should be ('Real men should ...', 'If you want a girl ...', 'Let me tell you how to talk to a girl'). This talk at first just made me uncomfortable, now I just get angry. I didn't do this consciously, I think I was way to young for that, but it was just a strong feeling that I had and at times I felt like I was crazy for being the only one who felt this way.  

For example, I remember in high school the P.E teacher made us go boy-girl-boy-girl to bat in baseball. The problem was there were four times as many boys, so I never got to go while the girls went three or four times. The teacher obviously did this on purpose, so I got mad at the teacher and all the girls instantly got mad at me, and the boys told me 'Don't be Gay'.

67,Would Apathy That Leads to Activism be Considered Feminism?,"So, for me, I don't call myself a feminist or really a supporter of many movements.

I kind of just see people as people. It's not that I want less rights for women and minorities or more rights for women and minorities, it's mainly that I don't care if someone is that. What I mean by this is that I support causes and go to rallies for causes that tend to support groups that are being oppressed or wronged in some way not because I support those groups, but moreso because I very strongly am against discriminating against those groups.

Recent example: I don't care if someone is an immigrant. It just doesn't really cross my mind to give a shit where they were born. I went to the ICE rallies, though, because the way they are being treated pissed me off, not that I support or don't support immigrants (I do, but that's not my motivation. Just a coincidence.)

Would this mindset be considered feminist? I don't support women, but I don't not support women. I just think the sex of a person shouldn't even come up in conversation because 99% of the time it really doesn't even matter, and so I tend to support causes that get us further towards eliminating the need to talk about sex.

95,Is feminism a path to happiness?,"I’ll first say that I’m a man without much interest in following the conventional path offered to me by the modern world. I, also, think the modern world has brought men low, in general, but that’s another topic. Society doesn’t offer much is the point. My question, how is feminism different?

I’m not that familiar with the ideology, but the main things have problems. For example:

Abortion: If you type “abortion sadistic” on google, most of the top results will be from left-wing commentators framing anti-abortion laws as “sadistic”. The language, when pro-abortion advocates win they speak of “reproductive rights”. When they face resistance, the resistance is “sadistic” or something along those lines. It’s dishonest. 

I know from my mom and sister that women love children. And what is abortion? It’s a woman’s violent act against herself and her child. There’s no winner. There’s no moral argument to justify abortion that can’t also, then, be used to justify murder. And I’ve never heard an abortion advocate who advocated for themselves to have been aborted. If it’s not good enough for oneself, then that person cannot decide that it’s good enough for another.

Abortion and morality are serious and I don’t see the Left speaking appropriately about its consequences. They should be spoken about seriously. Abortion is often winning the world while losing one’s soul. 

Work: We don’t know the hour or day but we do know who will be with us when we die. Family and friends. Not an employer. The system doesn’t want anybody in a personal way. So how could it answer for the personal needs of individuals, men or women? 

It seems like when feminism considers modern work, it’s an issue of equal pay between the sexes. I see the system forcing women into a loyalty that is not sufficient. There are better loyalties than loyalties to a system that has no personal care for you. Modern work is for most men a means to an end and a burden to endure. There’s nothing special about.

Men and Creativity: If you’re walking around in Paris, eventually a female tourist will give you her camera, asking for a selfie in front of the Eiffel Tower, or some other landmark. Two thoughts will cross your mind: (1) “Why not take the picture yourself? You’ll be able to forever see the Eiffel Tower through your own eyes.” (2) “A man did that”.

Feminism wants to magnify the destructive qualities of men while covering over the creative qualities of men. Men built Paris. They built Rome. The world’s a better place for it. There’s good and bad to male traits, and they have to be discussed on equal terms. If you don’t do that, I don’t think you will be able to understand men, and you’ll be depriving yourself of what they can offer. There’s also issues with the liberation and suffering themes of feminism, but that can be for another time.

I don’t think feminism is a path to happiness. I do think it’s won, though, for the moment. What do you think?

99,Whats your opinion on Witchwind?,"I haven’t been writing in a while, and it’s not because I don’t like writing any more but things have accelerated elsewhere in my life and I can’t be involved everywhere at once. As this isn’t paid work, obviously I can’t afford to put blogging first.

Anyway, there are still many posts waiting to be finished. In the meantime, I’ll start another one.

I often muse about all the things that we’d need to change about patriarchy if we abolished men’s rule over women and the earth. Everything and every single aspect of social organisation is so much the opposite of how it should be, it’s dizzying to even begin to think about all the things we should stop / change.

Mostly it’s about men stopping from doing harm. But stopping men isn’t enough because *beyond* that there is the entire world to relearn, to heal, and our entire society to rebuild. We would be faced with the immense task of replacing all the misogynist, genocidal, biocidal practices men have ordered our society with for eons. So many of us now are acculturated, cut from land, nature and from one another.

If we managed to overcome men’s tyranny over us, how would we rebuild our world? I just want to throw some ideas here that I often come across these days. I dream for concrete, down-to-earth, simple and easily applicable measures of stepping out of patriarchy into a female-loving, biophilic world. This isn’t by any means a realistic plan of how to achieve it, but just reading it makes me feel happy. It makes it feel more real, more possible. Enjoy!

**SOCIAL STRUCTURES**

**Men’s position in society**

Before we do anything, the very first measure to adopt is to take all men out of all positions of decision-making immediately, and actually out of any kind of social, professional position whatsoever.

Major serial killers, serial torturers, pimps, pornographers, severe domestic abusers, serial rapists, genocide planners, biocide planners and pedocriminals across the world will simply be euthanised: the decisions will be taken by women in a mass world tribunal for patriarchal crimes. This is by far the best solution, and is the most legitimate, ethical way of reducing male population to more reasonable levels. Such men would otherwise forever pose a threat to women, children, animals, the earth and society as a whole, and we know they have no chance of ceasing their violent behaviour after having reached such an advanced stage of sadism and sociopathy. It would be reckless to spend space, resources and energy in keeping them alive in prisons.

All of men’s (alive and euthanised) belongings, property, resources and land will be confiscated from men and handed back to female care and supervision – property rights over land will be abolished. You can’t own land!

All men at least above 15 (or younger if very asocial) should live separately from women and children, on their own in small huts or studios, isolated from one another and scattered around so that women can keep an eye on them (they should never be in groups or packs, that would be illegal). So it would also be illegal for male adults to impose their presence on females, girls and children. Men would have to care for themselves on their own: food, laundry, etc. No male above his age of puberty would be allowed to receive any kind of service from a female. Their life expectancy would probably drop to the age of 40, but that’s how things should be. Women’s life expectancy without men would rise to 130 years at least.

PIV would be illegal too of course, as well as the initiation of any verbal or physical contact to women and girls or boy children, unless solicited by a woman for specific matters. I’m not sure what to do about boy children. Obviously you know my opinion, but let’s say that’s up to the mother to decide what she wants to do before he turns of age to leave the female family circle.

In order to keep all men and post-pubescent boys busy, we’d send them to clean up the vast amounts of detritus, pollution and toxic wastes men have littered and almost killed the world with. Much of the damage to the earth is irreversible, however with a great deal of effort and genius, women will find sustainable, natural and simple ways of healing a lot of the damage men have caused, and send men off to do the dirty work. No man will be allowed to take any decision without female guidance. We know what happens when men decide on their own! DISASTER.

**Family, child-raising and reproduction**

Fathers’ rights will cease to exist. There is no such thing as fatherhood — as we all know, it’s a myth. Men will necessarily lose all and any power to dominate and control women’s reproductive capacities.

It’s the inalienable right of each woman to control every phase of her reproduction and life creation. Abortion will be possible at any stage of pregnancy, however there will hardly be such a thing as undesired pregnancy since there won’t be any men forcing pregnancies on us any more. Abortion will nonetheless be recognised for the trauma, mutilation and loss of life that it is. The number of children and human population will naturally decrease to sustainable levels, so will the number of males born. Women will be free to experiment parthenogenesis or procreation with two female eggs.

The nuclear family will be abolished, in particular the parent’s property rights and absolute power over her child. Children will be considered as persons in need for autonomy and all form of punishment, authority or educational manipulation over children will equally be abolished. Raising and caring for children will be a collective responsibility for women, and motherhood / childcare and especially capacity to be empathetic towards children will be taken very seriously, as something that needs to be (re)learned and studied over years before being fully competent for this immense task.

Schools as we know them as punitive reclusion centres for grooming into male domination and female subordination (as well as selection system for elite executors of patriarchal institutions) will be abolished. Boys would definitely not be around the girls, certainly not most of the time, and never beyond the age of puberty. And obviously no adult male would be allowed near children.

There will be no such thing as “teachers” with positions of authority over children. “Guiders” could learn also from the children or students as much the students from them. We’d learn anything we’d want from languages to sciences to art to music to medicine to building to witchcraft to swimming (etc) without restriction of age or time, as long as it’s adapted to our capacities, level and availability. Learning would be autonomous, with guidance when needed, instead of enforced and dictated. They’d be no need for external reward, marking or punishment because the process of learning in itself is so rewarding and fascinating that it’s self-sufficient. Anyway I could go on and on, non-patriarchal learning is truly riveting.

**Social structures between women.**

All relationships of authority, domination and subordination will be abolished between all women of all ages. We will be able to recognise each other’s strengths, expertise, guidance and capacities (or lack of) without it implying superiority, inferiority, veneration or lack of respect. We would find each other beautiful. We would live our friendships, love and affection for women unhindered.

**MEN’S INSTITUTIONS**

*All oppressive male institutions will be abolished after men have been retrieved from them. We obviously won’t keep these institutions. They will return to the nothingness that they belong, just as a distant, bad memory.*

**Military:**

No more military, no more army, no more wars! It would be illegal for men to hold weapons. Global peace would be the immediate consequence. Most weapons will be destroyed (or recycled into something else), such as weapons of mass destruction, anti-personnel mines, tanks, machine guns, all manners of terrestrial, marine and air-bombers, and all the many disgusting things men have invented. For the remaining weapons such as guns or blades, women will hold exclusive right of use over them in order to defend ourselves from men, from the risk of them taking power over us again.

**State:**

States, borders, nations, laws would be abolished and totally dispensed with. Laws mentioning the number of prohibited acts will be kept for men only. Women do not need laws to contain ourselves. Laws were created by the male elite to protect their property from other men. Laws are rigid and static, that’s because their purpose is to hold existing patriarchal powers in place. Our own society would be in constant evolution, improvement, creative renewal, yet grounded in reality and adapted to our needs and circumstances.

Women would be able to move freely.

Societal structures and decision-making assemblies wouldn’t exceed roughly 300 women (representing no more than themselves). Keeping numbers low for cooperation is important because the greater the size of the unit, the more horizontal cooperation becomes difficult and requires vertical hierarchy. Possibilities for peaceful, cooperative organisation between women are infinite – as long as they respect the individual integrity of every female – the group should never weigh over the individual but be a source for support and efficient organisation of collective life and space. There could easily be associations of exchange between different groups and peoples in order for women to cooperate regionally and globally where necessary. There would be no limit in age of participation in decision-making for women and girls, which means adapting the format to different ages and capacities.

**Medicine:**

Men would be permanently banned from any kind of medical practice. All woman-hating, genocidal institutions such as gynecology, psychiatry, obstetrics, big pharma, the torture of living beings in the name of “scientific experimentation” will be banned. Men’s fragmented, objectifying, sadistic view the human body will be part of history, replaced by biophilic medicine. Medical science will no longer be monopolised by a small elite but available to all at any age where appropriate. The (female) doctor’s role will be to guide the patient in her own healing, never to exercise authority over her or take decisions at her expense. Special healing spaces (where surgery is necessary, etc) will be so nice, warm and welcoming that just being there will make you feel better. The soul and life conditions of a person will always be considered part of the body, and symptoms will always be understood in a holistic way. There will be no more chemical, synthetic and toxic products with often worse side effects than the illness itself it claims to heal.

Perfect health would be the normal state of women anyway, as we will learn by experience and observation what we should eat and do to stay healthy at all seasons and times. Most women will have rediscovered our healing, divination and extra-sensory communication powers.

**Religion:**

Patriarchal religions will crumble down with men’s oppressive system. Religious ideologies, along with its hierarchies and vacuous rituals will cease to exist. I believe a woman’s world would be spiritual. Spiritual connection isn’t based on faith but on critical observation and experience, on a real personal connection to the elements, beings and spirits that surround us, and on the real magnetic power of beings.

**Economy (tied to ecology):**

Obviously, Slavery, men’s exploitation of women, men’s capitalist systems will be abolished too. The most important aspect of male economy is that it’s based on men’s competitive accumulation of resources (by killing, destroying, commodifying, taking control over, extracting the greatest possible amount of life) and based on production of poisonous, addictive, programmed obsolescent goods — in order to win the patriarchal game of achieving greater domination over women and girls.

This necrophilic relationship to the world and the environment will be abolished, to be replaced by biophilic ecological and economic principles. This will encompass every single process of our life activities, from house building, to food consumption, to communication, travelling, furniture making, cooking, etc. They will have to be carefully designed and thought out in a way as to never endanger the survival of any species, never pollute any environment, never require the use of poisonous, non-recyclable materials, never to require indentured labour or exploitation in order to be maintained. This would obviously impact the nature and scale of our activities. “Work” (exploitation and division of labour) as we know it would disappear. It would be the responsibility of each individual or group to sustain herself more or less autonomously.

We should learn to observe our environment and deeply understand the interconnectedness of all beings around us, as well our own impact before deciding whether or how to transform it. Our lives have no more or no less value than those of a rabbit, fly, tree, plant, fish, seashell or stone. For instance, if we pick leaves of some plants, it’s important not to rip the whole plant off, to take only parts of it so it can grow again. Or to only take a few plants (or seashells, whatever) where there are many, so to respect the survival of the species where it is settled. If we cut trees to build our house, replant them. There are also infinite ways of making the most of materials for energy, food or production while using it as efficiently as possible. Building houses in ways that don’t require heating in winter or cooling in the summer. It is now widely known that energy such as electricity can be infinitely renewable if we use wind power, magnetic power, water power… And everything can be made DIY.

We will learn to be autonomous again and make our own clothes, food, furniture, houses, soaps, detergent products – or maybe someone else will make them but most things can be handmade and it’s so much more rewarding.

In a biophilic world, nothing is garbage, nothing is pollution. Everything is conceived so as to be part of a life cycle. This doesn’t mean we should keep the same toothbrush for 50 years or never improve on our machines, technology and infrastructure, but there’s no such thing as a dump, or toxic spilling. All materials should be harmless, recyclable or biodegradable, given back the earth if we no longer need them.

**Industrial agriculture and farming:**

Genetic modification of plants, pesticides, monoculture, field ploughing and consequent aridification of the land will be considered criminal. Our right to self-sustenance would no more be confiscated by mega food corporations – as they will no longer exist.

Agriculture should always be small-scale, local, and as much as possible be modelled on wildlife, self-growing / self-renewing conditions (the less work and intervention, the better), and especially be conceived so as to nourish and sustain rather than deplete wildlife and environmental balance. Again, possibilities are infinite, we have so much to learn.

And seriously, killing animals you’ve raised yourself in a farm or keeping animals enclosed is cruel. I’m for the liberation of all farm and domestic animals. It’s up to them to decide whether they want to live with us or not, and they should be able to come and go freely. Maybe after a few decades, after the human population has stalled, male population has decreased, and after we’ve made serious efforts for reforestation and restoration of wildlife on the earth, it would probably be fairer to hunt animals occasionally. Right now, given the extinction rate of animal species, I find it criminal to hunt or fish. We don’t need to eat that much meat anyway.

102,"What exactly is wrong with some video games, or any other media, ""appealing to the male fantasy""?","Both men and women have sexual fantasies. Often, these are highly un-PC and not compatible with ""polite society"", hence why many people have a bedroom persona which is totally different to their outward personality. In my own case, I'm a 100% submissive between the sheets, while being a fairly stubborn, extroverted and assertive character in my day to day interactions with people.

Fictional media (as distinct from say news reports, factual documentaries and dramatisations, etc) are primarily consumed by many people as a form of escapism from day to day life, particularly if one's day to day life does not - as, let's face it, most peoples' lives do not - align with the life they fantasise about.

In that context, what's the problem with appealing to fantasy? Plenty of films and books appeal to the stereotypical female fantasy as well as others which appeal to the stereotypical male fantasy. Now, if someone wanted to say ""more video games should appeal to the female fantasy so there's a diversity of choices to suit all tastes"" then I'd be 100% behind that sentiment. But this idea which is being thrown around as a soundbite, that ""appealing to the male fantasy"" is inherently a bad thing, and by extension implying that male fantasies are inherently bad and men should never be allowed to enjoy their escapism into the world of their fantasies, seems incredibly mean-spirited, authoritarian and anti-male.

Even if the intention behind the sentiment is different to its most obvious interpretation, the very expression ""this is bad because it appeals to the male fantasy"" doesn't sit well with me at all. It implies that men simply shouldn't be allowed any gratification of their fantasies, or that if they are, it's inherently not a good thing.

Many women have fantasies which are very much un-PC in the same regard. I know several women who have fairly graphic BDSM and rape fantasies, for example. And obviously as a male sub, I've sought out and encountered many women in my lifetime who have fantasies of dominating, tormenting, even hurting men - obviously in my case these women are my ""type"" so I don't give a second thought to the inherent ""uncivlisation"" of such fantasies. For what it's worth, most female doms I've known are incredibly nice people outside the bedroom in their day to day interactions, and it's perfectly possible for male doms to be the same.

In that context, why is ""appealing to the X fantasy"" (replace X with ""male"" or ""female"") a bad thing? The whole *point* of fictional media is to allow people to indulge in daydreaming and escapism.

This is an interesting example of a phenomenon I've noticed, whereby the concept of 'equality' in feminism apparently cannot be approached from the libertarian end of the scale - in that for instance I believe in equality here, absolutely, but that does *not* mean reducing the amount of media intended to invoke male sexual fantasy or gratification. It simple means encouraging more media which invokes female sexual fantasy and gratification, so that *both* genders can experience the blissful escapism of media which appeals to their ideal world as opposed to the imperfect world in which we live. That, to me, is the whole point of fiction in general, regardless of the medium by which it is written or transmitted.",AskFeminists,1533066003,hatrickpatrick,100,6,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/93hoiw/what_exactly_is_wrong_with_some_video_games_or/,2018-07-31

120,Are there any people here that have at some point identified with or as part of the Men's Rights Movement (or similar)?,"I ask this, because that i want to see if anyone has had a similar experience to me (what i will describe next is quite oversimplified). When I first started researching 'Equality', there was lots of media pointing me towards becoming a feminist. People like Emma Watson, saying if you're for equality, you're a feminist. It was clear to me at the time that this was correct. Then I noticed a certain... apathy towards how the feminist movement viewed men and male issues. I became distanced from the feminist movement and eventually became an MRA. This continued for a while until i noticed that some of what was said on those forums wasn't warranted (mostlyy in relation to how 'evil' feminism is), and started to research feminism again. Afterwards i became slightly disenfranchised from the MRM. My views kept on changing, and still indeed are, and this is where i am today.

129,I have a question about emotional vulnerability.,"To give a little context, I actually live the same kind of life as a MGTOW monk except that I don't buy into gender essentialist 'biotruths' about women OR men. I maintain a pretty level view balanced between innate 'qualities' and social conditioning. So as far as I know, I can't call myself MGTOW according to the common perception of it (both from the inside and the outside).

Having said that, I have a question for the feminists here. I've seen more than a few responses from feminists about MGTOW that seem to conflate men retreating from a horribly broken, malign and bigoted system that, frankly, targets ordinary men as an 'enemy' and an 'other' that has to be controlled, curtailed, monitored and discarded as soon as his usefulness is over.

I won't go into how this ongoing assault on ordinary men shows up in the prison population, suicide, educational and academic failure to see these boys and men as human, the family court pogroms including VAWA, Duluth Model (with the attendant arrest policies and LEO training), the hopeless condition of fatherhood, etc. These are all well known and have been discussed at length here and elsewhere.

What I want to ask about is, with everything I just mentioned, why is it that the responses to some questions always seem to conflate men simply trying to survive the horror show I mentioned above with fear of 'emotional vulnerability'? What on earth does emotional vulnerability have to do with not wanting to risk one's well-being, mental health, livelihood, freedom and even their life just to have an intimate relationship? I can't seem to make that connection...

You may have to ELI5 it for me, but I just can't see how being able to cry or express sadness, fear, joy, contentment or confusion will help a man when he's in front of a judge pleading for his freedom and reputation after calling the police because he was physically defending himself against a partner trying to stab him. I get terribly confused when I'm told that a little boy will be a successful student if he 'calls out' another boy's misbehavior toward a girl (or other boy), when he then goes in to class and gets treated like a second class citizen who gets his grades lowered due to his gender, isn't allowed to play with the 'boy's toys', is deliberately called on last when raising his hand, and finally drugged into a stupor simply for being more prone to needing physical activity to remain focused and learn.

I don't want to make this post too long, but I think you get the idea... This question could be applied to an enormous number of issues ordinary men and boys face, across western culture.

Please understand; I do NOT blame feminism or any group of feminists for the above exclusively. I understand that many of these issues are either the deliberate manipulation of the social contract and the government BY MEN in power in order to subjugate and marginalize ordinary men and boys. I get that. But at least some of these threats have either been put in place by feminism using the proxy of male politicians who want those women's votes, or they have been, I'm sorry, specifically dismissed by particular feminists as 'not affecting women, so not a priority'. This last being something of a final slap in the face (ESPECIALLY when I see and hear it from male feminists), and is what convinces me that I have no place in the world of intimate relationships. At all. I'm not 'red pill' as promoted in places like Reddit, I have NO interest in conservatism, 'the good ol' days' or bashing women, and I have absolutely NO interest whatsoever in 'white supremacy'. (To any alt-righters/europa/ethnostaters lurking here, as far as I'm concerned you've all flunked history, current events and even math. Your dog just don't hunt). 

Anyway, this is already too long, but let me just finish with this: I said at the top that I don't buy into biotruths or any corrupted darwinian gender essentialism. This is NOT a concession to any other theory or ideology. It is an indictment. All adult men AND women everywhere in this culture are (with the exception of those specifically disabled) free to help build a better world and social contract that everyone can live with. What feminism and quite a lot of the social justice advocates in general have come to the table with so far is a simple list of demands that the powerful people scramble to meet, usually at the expense of... Us. Ordinary men and boys. I'm not gonna say I'm a MGTOW, but I sure as hell ain't gonna play THAT game anymore.

First post here, I’ve been lurking on the RP/MGTOW subs for a few weeks after discovering that my boyfriend of 2.5 years is subscribed to them, so wanted to see what’s they’re all about. I once confronted him about it, asking if he is after the non-committal, ‘plate spinning’ ideal that those guys are, and he claims not, just that he follows because he finds it an interesting phenomenon. Should I believe him? It makes me uncomfortable that he’s reading that stuff on a daily basis (I frequently catch him reading articles they post and he has even sent some to me- I don’t think he has figured out I know the exact subreddit source), and makes me worried that his mentality will change very quickly (I don’t know when exactly this started, but I reckon within the last 8-10 months).

142,Feminists can be sexual?,"Online I've seen a lot of articles from self proclaimed feminists that any woman who chooses to wear makeup/express their sexuality is a victim to the patriarchy, they're contributing to the oppression of women. Even female artists like Rihanna, Beyonce, Janet Jackson have all been accused of being slutty/over sexualized freaks, which is a little disappointing when they're treated like they're diseased by some, I like wearing the same things they do, and I think sexuality is too subjective to label like that.

But those self proclaimed feminists are exhibiting sexist behaviour themselves: forcing women into being conservative is just as exploitive because your still using their body against their will to somebody else's advantage.

I like a little bit of everything. Somedays I'll wear mini skirts/heels/makeup, other days I'll wear a full mens suit and mens sneakers. But if being a feminism means giving up that side of myself or that I'm ruining other women, then I don't want to join.

158,"I hate being a woman, is this normal? I need to know if other women feel this way. (NSFW, rant)","I am going to ramble ahead, it might be long, sorry, so you might want to skip this post. I might delete this later, but I really felt the need to write this, and maybe this is as good a place as any.

I hate being a woman. Right now I am 26 years old, and I am a transgender woman. This is relevant for me because before being a trans woman, I was a girl, a trans girl.

Growing up trans is weird. Where cis people are punished by society for rebelling against what society tries to brainwash you to be like for trans people it’s the opposite. The world shows you girls should like X, you learn that, then you’re punished for conforming. It’s not worse really, just confusing.

I learned so many things as a trans girl during my childhood, and some of them I don’t even mind that much. Do I like dresses because society said girls were supposed to, and media showed my role models wearing them? Probably. And it’s wrong that it does, but I don’t feel like an inherently inferior person because of it.

But there are so many darker things. In the patriarchy the main purpose women have is to be breeding stock and to be a sexual object. Of course, the first one is utterly impossible for me, but a child doesn’t really understand that, and keeps on hoping for miracles.

Then came puberty, and reality crashed in. The reality was that I would never bear children, and I felt ashamed and worthless for it. My body also developed, in all ways contrary to the image I was supposed to fulfil, so body image problems were coupled with the body dysphoria that comes from having too much testosterone in your system, not a good recipe. I had failed at everything the world said was expected of me. Not what people around me expected of me of course, not pre transition, but still what I had learned should draw my self-worth from.

Later on in my life I came into contact with mainstream feminism. I honestly have to say, it didn’t really help me. If trans women were women, then they were women who grew up as boys, and so it didn’t help understand my experiences. It was when I found transgender women who were feminist that I understood, my experiences growing up as a girl, a trans girl, probably not even remotely similar to a cis girl, but not a boy.

But feminism in the end can make you understand exactly how and why you are broken, it can give you tools to manage it, it can arm you to fight so the next generation might grow up to be a little less messed up. But what it can’t do is fix you, not really.

Later on in my life I started to physically transition. Right now I don’t look like a cis woman, maybe I’ll never do, but I no longer look like a man. I now have the kind of body that can be sexualized, not by gay men as a man, but by straight men as a woman. I know it, small, curvy, soft skin, I’ve seen many less conventionally attractive trans women approved by them. Not in the mainstream, of course, you have to go to your designated place and you have to call yourself an extra slur or two (trap, shemale, who cares) just so the men won’t feel threatened, but still, as a woman.

It would just be sexualizing yourself, not that special, most women have had worse, I’ve had worse. I could also have sex with a man, as a woman. I would be his dirty little secret, and he would see me as nothing close to resembling a person, but I would still feel validated by it, I’m sure of it, it’s what this world made me to want. For now I don’t, because as much as I need it, even knowing why I, it disgusts me, because I know why.

But in the end does it really matter if I don’t actually do it? What have I accomplished? A clock can stop telling time, but if you look at the mechanisms you can still tell that it’s what it was designed for. And it’s the same with me. I still have the rape fantasies, the desire to be consumed like a piece of meat, and so, so much more. If I am a freak in body, am I not, at least in mind, the perfect fuckhole that patriarchy tries to make out of all women?

So I hate being a woman. Or rather, I hate being the way I am, and I am the way I am because I had the fucking misfortune of \[being born/becoming/however gender arises\] a girl, a trans girl, in this vomit inducing world. If I had been born a boy or, more to the point, a cis boy I know I wouldn’t be twisted in the ways I am today. I’d probably be warped in other ways and would probably be a worse person to the people around me, but I think I’d be less disgusted with myself.

2,"I want to get on board with feminism, but struggle with not knowing if someone feminists are ok with reversing sexism so it goes against men. Any insight?","I know feminists don't ""HATE ALL MEN!"" or whatever claptrap anti-feminists are throwing around these days. Even if you don't agree with the specifics in one area that hardly means they hate men. 


However, I have been struggling with the idea that there might not be toleration for men who have concerns about areas reversing to go against men. I knew about [a study most know about](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/study-shows-gender-bias-in-science-is-real-heres-why-it-matters/) I always thought this was one of the best reasons to push forward with feminist ideas. When we see inherent biases it is a sign that things arent level. 

However, I've come across a [more recent study](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/04/women-preferred-21-over-men-stem-faculty-positions) from a credible source that says women are twice as likely to be preferred in positions in STEM. And that is ok, it doesn't refute the other study. It just might suggest a shift in the tide. After all, a good while back I read about a study of the show the weakest link (a game show that can reveal our biases because it involves kicking out other contestants based on how good we think they are) that concluded black people and women were not discriminated against but the elderly and Latinos were. The conclusion was that since much work was done in combating stereotypes against black people and women our biases lessened and the other biases that were not addressed against the latter groups were in full swing. 


I also think there are **two** aspects to equality. One is the group and the other is the individual. When women see what the first study says they can see sexism that attacks them as individuals, but they might also look up at beyond the individual levels and see that there are more men in such and such an area so that regardless of the specific reason they feel their group is underrepresented. In other words we want ourselves to be free rom individual discrimination, but we also want the structure to treat our groups evenly. Not sure if I am making sense here...but if not then you can ask for clarity. And if I am wrong maybe you could clear it up for me. 


So, anyway. While I understand women thinking it is good to increase the numbers of women in STEM do you feel it is ok for some men to feel it is unfair for preferences to swing in the other direction where women are twice as likely to get selected and divorced mothers are preferred to married fathers. For me, it feels like a two-wrongs-make-a-right type of thing if someone is ok with that. (**NOTE:** This does not mean I'm against affirmative action as that is consciously about helping even the structural problems. This however isn't affirmative action as it is what people are choosing outside of the program) 


Perhaps I'll be seen as holding back progress because 50/50 would be too slow to get women into an even playing field. And I understand that, but at the same time while men succeed in the group level (plenty of representation) it feels like the suggestion a young guy trying to go into the field should be ok with being less likely to get hired (outside of programs designed to level the field) is a little unfair if I am honest. 


And, honestly, my thoughts are not with this issue that much but more are you considered a bad person for not liking this. If someone raises this concern or wants it changed do you feel that they are along the lines of anti-feminists or MRAs etc if not in dialogue but in tone.

Thanks for reading and any thoughts would be really helpful.

P.S. This isn't to mean that there's no problems facing women in STEM by the way... but I am just looking at this particular issue.

Again, a fetus is not really a human being for a long part of the pregnancy (there can be debate on how long), and at that point it’s not murder. But the fetus is definitely a human being 1 Minute before birth, right? So there has to be some point before birth when he becomes a human.

That makes the debate basically is what is more important- body autonomy or human life. When thinking about this question just in regard to abortions, the answer seems to be body autonomy, that’s why I was always pro choice.

But recently I thought about a similar scenario- Siamese twins. Is one of them allowed morally to kill the other, justified by his bodily autonomy?

13,In regards of Finland and gender,"Hello r/AskFeminists! I've decided to spice my day up with some good ol' debating and discussion, so let me present my question/subject:

First of all, I do not personally agree with the social gender, but let's say for this scenario it is indeed social and individually determined. Now we can dive into the meat of this post: **Finland, which so happens to be where I'm from, and in particular Finnish language doesn't have a word for gender.** 

My language's closest equivalent pretty much says itself that it is biological/genital based AND dual. The word is *Sukupuoli*, *suku* meaning family or lineage on its own, and *puoli* meaning half or side, referencing the binary, and the two ""sides"" of reproduction. So all in all, we only have a word for the biological sex.

So what this means is that the ""non-binary"" or even arguably transgenderism doesn't work linguistically in Finnish, as there is no culturally based concept to clash with the biological to begin with. 

Seta(*Seksuaalinen Tasa-arvo*, sexual-equality in english, a human-rights organization in Finland) has been trying to apply the western concepts in Finnish education system by splitting our ""gender"" in three: biological (the original and widely regarded as the normal), psychological (the gender of English) and social (how others view your gender identity). However, nobody uses the latter two, as you'd have to specifically say ""sosiaalinen/psykologinen sukupuoli"", because the biological is dominative and has existed beyond memory. I hear many joking about the non-binary in Finland, as it is a foreign concept here.

In conclusion, I don't really care, nor do many Finns either, about wether or not gender is social or not, as it doesn't really work here. Sure, the more multi-cultural capital could be somewhat buying it, but it doesn't really work when you think about it. If I were to present this as a question, I could ask you: **What is your opinion and thoughts about the lack of gender in the Finnish language, and thus the incompatibility of non-binary?**

16,do you think equal average pay between men and women is viable?,"given the differences on average between men and women both physical, and psychological i find it very surprising that so many people push for completely equal wages between men and women. 

on average men are physically stronger and larger which is going to give them an advantage in those fields, and yes i know there are some very strong women, but when were looking at averages these outliers don't matter much.

beyond the physical differences it seems there is also some differences in the brain, which probably isn't surprising since just about every other part of our bodies is different in some way. i know women have been found to respond more strongly to cute images. also men have more grey matter in there brain, and women have more white matter, along with more connections between the two hemispheres of the brain. for the latter example they actually repeated the test on babies to prove it was biological, and not social. 

it seems to me that almost any differences on average between the sexes will create a difference in average earnings one way or another that is very unlikely to all balance out. i mean using the cute pictures example it is possible to hypothesize that if women value cuteness more than men, there will always been more women working with young children. because money is not the only factor in choosing ones job. it seems highly unlikely to me that men well ever spend as much time off in total for kids as women do, and i don't think it's a problem as long as everyone happy about it, and if some men want to do more of the childcare than there wife. well thats great, but on average i don't see that happening.

17,Why don't feminists teach implied consent?,"I was on a Tinder date, we had a coffee and then sat by the river.  I touched her hair and then kissed her but we didn't go home that same first date.

She was pretty into it but also a bit nervous.  By the way when we sat by the river there were other people not far from us at all (basically same steps).

I didn't ask for her consent before I started touching her, I just read her body language.  For example I only kissed her after she started touching her own hair.

I am trying to be a feminist ally so when she was looking away and acting nervous I tols her to look me in the eyes, which she did and she was smiling.

Why don't feminists teach that all this implies consent to being touched?

Going to sit with a guy alone off if a tinser date implies he can start making a move on you.  Smiling, playing with your hair implies he can make a move on you. Letting him lift you up (she was suuuuper short and I wanted to show her I could easily pick her up) which I did before we sat there all contributes to consent.

Why don't feminists teach these facts of life?

Women have to learn it for themselves through experience and so do men, and it will lead to some awkward or unwelcome experiences as they both learn.

19,Why are female representation in male dominated spheres such as engineering and board rooms in private corporations (as an example) prioritized by feminist politicians?,"To start off with saying I’m a 22 yo woman and consider myself feminist. I’m from Northern Europe and I’ve noticed recently that many ”feminist politicians” want a 50/50 distribution in male dominated spheres like engineering, coding, board rooms in private corporations, judicial system etc and I have a hard time understanding how this will make society treat women better. How does more women in engineering do away with harmful stereotypes about women where men feel entitled to a woman etc?

I mean, there are cultural and societal stereotypes about women that are extremely harmful. In some parts of the world women are still treated as second class citizens. Even in my own modern and liberal country I can’t move freely without being on edge because of the risk of being catcalled or assaulted sexually by a man.

How does more women in board rooms or in engineering help society change the perception of women that SOME men still hold? And why are feminist politicians insisting on instilling a 50/50 distribution when the real problems are cultural and moral values about women that are harmful? 

I’m not saying it’s a bad idea to have more women represented in society, but why does it have to be 50/50? Is it going to fail if it’s 49%?

I want feminism to change harmful opinions and ideas about women. How can some feminists strongly advocate for more women in engineering as some important cause when women aren’t respected and treated with dignity in the first place?

32,Debating my sister (who is a feminist) about 50/50 representation,"Hello, this is my first post on this sub. I'm having a debate with my sibling who is a feminist.

Her claim is that unless there is a 50/50 representation between the genders at any company/field etc. It's due to discrimination. Using a ""gender quota system"" (not sure what it's called in English) is a good way to achieve this, she explains it as giving favor to a gender in a workplace if that gender is not equally represented as the other gender in a 50/50 fashion.

I think it's systematic discrimination. Instead of females being discriminated against, it would shift into males being discriminated against or vice versa depending on the field/company. It appears one is only changing who is being discriminated, not discrimination itself. The hiring process should remain identical if you erase name, gender etc. from the papers, should it not?

Fewer women choose technology as their education compared to men based on statistics. You can't use quotas to reach 50/50 at the workplace and still have a functional company since you can't hire people who don't exist, otherwise you'll sacrifice merits in favor of gender and that is discrimination. The other outcome would be to have fewer tech companies and a bunch of unemployed males that can't get a job in the field they've chosen to educate themselves in.

To achieve a 50/50 representation, you have to start long before you send in your resume.

35,"""New age"" feminism","Hi!

This is mostly a question for american feminists (for cultural reasons) but I'll take all answers.

The first time I remember reading about patriarchy and men being viewed as a sort of normal standard was in a book by Diane Stein about crystals and chakras and stuff that I borrowed from my mother as a little girl. Now I found out Starhawk is giving a conference near me (I live in Europe) about ecofeminism and it brought to my attention that there had been a fairly big (or at least seems big) feminist esoteric movement back in the 60s-70s in America.

I was wondering if you felt that particular branch of feminism had left a long-lasting legacy in modern feminists? Any meaningful contributions?

Some critiques I would have (I reborrowed the book by Diane Stein out of curiosity but otherwise my sources are limited) is that they seem to mention patriarchy a lot (""ancient knowledge being confiscated from women"") without ever mentioning colonialism. I find that especially unsettling since most of them are white women making money from hindu and buddhist concepts. I also feel there's something TERF-y (or at least that reeks of gender essentialism) about speaking of divine feminity, the power of the womb...

36,What constitutes infantilization?,"My fiancee is adamant that the term ""girls"" inherently infantilizes the adult female population regardless of context, whereas the term boys does not due to the male privilege inherent in its use.

I admittedly know very little about feminism outside of how it intersects with political and class warfare, so the social aspect is a little harder for me to grasp. So, I usually default to her opinion even if it seems incorrect to me.

However this has been a point of contention.

I can see how ""girls"" is infantilizing in a professional setting or through the tone used, as ""boys"" would be too, but don't believe either to be inherently infantilizing.

""The girls went out to eat but the boys had a grill out instead."" Doesn't seem infantilizing to either party to me, nor if you separated it into two sentences.

Or maybe I just don't fucking get it.

39,"I'm becoming disillusioned with many feminists, concerning around the discussion of objectification.","Hello everyone, this has come up in my mind a few days ago, and i'd figure that i'd share my thoughts a bit, and get a few answers from a subreddit that isn't a red pill crap-heap.

I've been lurking around feminist subreddits and articles recently, concerning discussions of objectification. I otherwise agree on every other subject of feminism, including the objectification of women, but the way many feminists go about with objectification is disillusioning me quite a lot. I'm sorry if this kinda sounds like a ""whataboutism"", but that's honestly how i feel right now.

For me, it seems to go like this: whenever a women is sexually objectified in a piece of media, the choice in particular is rightfully called out about it; that it dehumanizes the woman in question, that it takes a way from her character and as a result, paints women as objects, when done en masse.

Despite this, i see many feminists be downright supportive of male objectification: to have butt shots of men in games and movies, to have even more Magic Mikes, to get some of that Nightwing action etc. 

In circumstances where people'd still realize that normalizing objectification of men is bad thing, i'd be fine with. I'm someone who feels as if objectification, when separated from the shit system we live in and not done to shit, is harmless. However, quite a fair few feminists which discuss the issue, are downright happy about, and even encourraging the objectification of men in media, without any ""buts"" or ""howevers"".

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/11170286/Why-Britains-women-are-allowed-to-sexually-objectify-men.html

I strongly **object** (puns) to this, because reversing the social hierarchy of objectification would go against the idea of feminism being a ""mutual positive"" for both genders; that men are no longer being exclusively put on a pedestal of high standard, strength and stoic behavior, while women are no longer pushed around by others, treated with constant disrespect and inferiority. Granted, one side benefits more  from the movement (the women) but only because they are even worse off than men overall, and the final result leaves men and women at equal odds. Being lenient on the objectification of men would lead to it being normalized, hence allowing for women to have that monumental advantage (which men have right now), to think of men as having no agency in sexual activity. This'd not only pad on to already high standards which many men have on them (in terms of body and having good looking penis and having toned muscles etc), but would give people reasons to join MRA groups for the sake of not being treated like a toy, as it seems for that person as if pushes for feminism would have caused that. And thus, we end up in a back and forth situation where it's a battle to see which gender can objectify the other the hardest, for the sake of wanting to express freely.

I understand that the objectification of men as of now is quite different in its side effects to female objectification, as men as a whole are still seen as humans, even after being objectified. However, that is mainly because the objectification is a normalize and omnipresent problem, where even the woman in the most obscure and innocuous game, has some sort of body standard or gendered cliche attached to her. Saying that male objectification is ""okay"" without detail of consequence, would lead to an opposite scenario.

41,What's the general feminist view (or your personal view) on Surrogacy?,"So, this is kind of a personal, important topic for me. Like, since I was a kid I always dreamed of being a dad and having a family. And I guess that was one of the many reasons it took me until I was 21 before I accepted I was gay, and while, I was okay with replacing a wife with a husband, I was afraid that would mean I'd never have children. It still gets me down a lot, though I think I'm still too young for a family any time soon. My options are very limited. I could adopt, but ontop of that being expensive, it's a very long procedure (years), you gotta be vetted as a pretty much perfect couple (compared to a  straight couples who can be the most irresponsible humans alive, but still have kids), and in my country, most children are either adopted by family members, or they're originally from eastern european countries, particularly Russia, who will not allow gay couples to adopt their children. Fostering might be an option with the same vigorous vetting, but I don't know if I have it in me to house a kid and grow to adore and love them, knowing they can be taken back, sent home or rehoused at a moment's notice. 

Surrogacy is the other option where price is the only real challenge, although again here, it's a legal nightmare as it is neither legal, nor illegal, but will also let me or my husband have a biological connection to the baby. However it's been brought to my attention that the practise can (or is) exploitative of women, which is a valid point but opinions are mixed.

42,The pay gap,"There is currently a pay gap between men and women in the USA. 

Feminists believe that the cause of that pay gap is primarily discrimination against women in the workplace, and not primarily a result of different life choices or life priorities that women tend to make. 

Anti-feminists see many “fair” reasons that women earn less than men on average such as, fewer women have been taking educations that lead to high paying careers such as Law, MDs, and STEM, and more women have other (arguably better) priorities in life besides chasing money. (Believe me, I did it, and it literally sucked the soul out of me. It took nothing less than a pathological level of obsession, effort, and sacrifice as well as a constant state of transience) 

I work in a very highly paid role. Not many women have taken my path. And I see no barriers to why women couldn’t have. I started in the army. They encourage women so much to join the army to the extent of lowering the bar for entry, yet very few apply. I then applied for the officer corps, even fewer women do this, and I cannot see any reason besides their own choice. That, background allowed me to accrue an impressive resume, and I won a traineeship at a trading firm. These traineeships are highly competative and there can be hundreds of applicants for every position since there are no formal prerequisites. Despite this, maybe ten percent of the applicants are women. Women are highly sought after in this industry as they are known to be favored by clients, yet they are super rare in the industry. Because they choose not to enter. And that might be a smarter choice actually. It isn’t a healthy lifestyle. There is absolutely nothing wrong with making the choice to have a less taxing career and consequently making less money. I would easily trade in my hours I work and travel beyond 40 hours a day, for pro rata reduction in pay, but when you are competing against people who do work all the time unfortunately that isn’t an option. In this business it is winner take all. There is no reward for being second best.

I should add a few details that seem relevant. The experience I have is mostly with a Scandinavian firm where they have very pro-woman policies including equal opportunity for parental leave. Yet even in Scandinavia the female applicants are almost a statistical insignificance. It is also important to note that the women who do apply are usually accepted, as they tend to do very well as alluded to before, so there appears to me to be no glass ceiling. The job is known to be highly competative and regularely results in mental breakdown and heath failure. The risks are high, the pace is high, the margins are thin, the work/life balance is laughable, so there is a reason it is highly paid and every day I ask myself if it is worth it, but at this point it it all I know, so I keep doing it.

But I only know two industries. My antecdotes are only a tiny fraction of the overall picture. Maybe the overall data is different. I respect data, I make risk decisions based on data on a daily basis so I am used to having my impressions showed to be wrong.What data is there that controls for all of the variables women themselves are in control of, and still show a gender gap in pay that could be attributed to discrimination in the USA. Can anyone show a source for that?

I believe that life begins at conception. I am a man, a conservative, and I have no desire to control women or control their bodies. Any public figure who tells you otherwise doesn't know me.

I also do not believe that you are evil people who believe women should have the power over life and death of a child. I think you honestly do not believe that abortion is ending a person's life, and that is why you support it and believe it is a ""women's issue"" as opposed to a ""human rights issue.""  My questions is, if not conception, when do you believe is the moment when a person's life begins, and ""something"" becomes ""someone?""

45,Justice for the falsely accused,"My apologies in my writing style and I maybe slightly slow in my response as i'm not fantastic at writing or grammar but here it goes.

I think we can all agree, committing crime and lying about a crime being committed is a horrible thing and in most if not all types of crime, it is only a small amount of people who are proven to lie about a crime happening, but crimes of rape and sexual assault hold a much stronger taboo compared to the likes of theft and in some cases murder (I admit this part may be a tad anecdotal). The reason I say this is because businesses and most people are more likely to fire, deny jobs, assault or shun people based on these accusations even if they are proven false,where the former has more leniency and scepticism involved. 

Whether or not you agree this is correct/fair is not necessarily what my main point about this.

In the case of John Leslie recently where he became unemployable from this accusation that turned out to be false and in the case of Liam Allan and many others, I think there should be a change in the system to get true justice. 

1) Dual anonymity (from the public and media) for both accused and accuser ( in case of breach of this see below)

2) A trial to prove the accuser committed the crime 

3a) If the accused is proven to commit the crime then give them a suitable punishment drop any charges of d/s/l

3b) If it is proven they did not commit the crime or there is a lack of evidence for it, then a second trial should occur to see the nature of accusation 

4a)If it is proven their was malice and if the person has had not history with relating mental illness then they should get the same punishment as what the falsely accused person would of gotten and/or be forced to pay forced to pay for defamation/slander/ libel if they can't then have some state involvement to pay it.

4b)If it is proven the accuser was still a victim of the crime but accidentally got the identity of the accuser wrong then drop charges of d/s/l  and have the state pay for any damage 

4c)If it is due to a lack of evidence then have state compensate for damage and drop d/s/l charges 

4d) If it proven the accused is innocent and the accuser has a proven history of related mental illness then drop d/s/l charges and commit them to mental hospital/give them mental health help. And have the state pay for d/s/l damages.

I thought on these parameters in order to have innocent until proven guilty and justice prevail but also because i see a lot of talk on a deterrent for making up lies but not too much on helping the falsely accused which i think needs just as much attention as they are also victims of a crime.

I wont pretend i have a law degree or anything of the sort but i am intressted in hearing your response to this proposal.

Again my apologises by language and grammar have never been great and this is the first post i have ever made on this site so i may of missed something in this proposal/justifications that may be needed.

47,"can feminist boys come on to girls, ask them out, make moves on them, etc?","I read many of the 85 answers to my last post.  Maybe I'm not a feminist. People said I wrote about rape culture.  I would like to learn your point of view so I can decide if I'm a feminist.  Maybe I'm not.

In feminism can girls get boys to come on to them?  Like this: girl likes a boy, makes it pretty obvious.  Boy sees girl is interested in him, he talks to her and asks her out.  girl goes out with him or she rejects the date (she can say anything, has something else to do, whatever.  if she is interested she makes the time, if she is just excuses she doesn't want to see you).  both have happened to me.

they go out on a date and if it goes well the boy can try to start touching her (slowly) and see how she reacts, wants more, etc.  this is what I think was normal but I did not understand this is rape culture, especially from tinder.  you can hold a girl's hand and very clearly see if she is letting you or not.

I thought when they're young and inexperienced men and women they have awkward moments while they learn how to judge the other sex and figure out how to get what they want, but it's pretty obvious if a girl is into you or is agreeing or rejecting to things.  so can the above happen?  if not how is feminist dating work?  do feminists think all sexually active people are participating in rape culture - and if not how are they having sex, because the above is very accurate description of actually going out.

Someone compared my statements about my tinder date to the idea ""Breathing the same air implies consent"" which I thought was absurd.

How is a girl supposed to get a feminist boy if he is not allowed to ask her out or touch her even if the date is going well and she wants it, is smiling, very receptive, holding his hand, etc, and he is not being forceful.

48,Are there advantages women have over men that make up for the pay gap?,"Women are monitarily disadvandaged in the workplace mostly due to the direct and indirect effects of pregnancy and infant care. (Feminist Source: https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2014/05/19/90039/explaining-the-gender-wage-gap/ )

Are there any advantages in society that you can see that make up for or at least partly make up for it to balance things out?

A few examples I have seen:

I can’t help but notice how women have an easier time getting personal favors done. Need your apartment painted? Volunteers are easy to find. Need a good deal on a car repair? You likely have a handy friend more than willing to help for a case of beer. 

Casual sex is FAR easier for the average woman to obtain. I would disagree that this is worth as much to women as it would be to men (for example, I would gladly take 91 cents on the dollar to have the same casual sex access that women have, I doubt the average woman would value the advantage THAT much), but Steven Fry was recently lambasted by Rosie Boycott for suggesting that women weren’t as horny for casual sex as men.

Anyways I named two advantages alone alone that could conceivably make up for the wage gap, but do you disagree? Why? Can you name any advantages under the status quo that I haven’t thought of?

59,Which sex is more likely to be the victim of Sexual or Domestic Abuse from the opposite sex?,"Hello, I was wondering if people here could point to some good literature on the subject in the title. I feel like I don't know what to believe on this specific subject with some people arguing that women clearly have it worse compared to men, others saying that the statistics show that men are at least or even worse off than women if things like sexist under-reporting for men's issues are taken into account and still others saying that we shouldn't fixate on who has it worse when we should be all working to destroy the problem for everyone. I know that last viewpoint is valid, but I kind of feel like it dodges the issue that could have lots to say about gender imbalances and sexism in the modern world if there clearly isn't parity between sexes.

Another thing, and I feel very hesitant to bring this up, but somebody I was talking to recently stated her distaste with this debate since she thought it treated all domestic and sexual abuse as the same and that she thought that the kind of abuse where somebody was physically beaten or locked up and had their freedom of movement removed from them was categorically worse than a lot of the emotional abuse that could involve things like gas-lighting and undermining someones self worth. I should be clear she was fully aware that that kind of thing can ruin lives but nevertheless felt there was a clear difference in terms of the Moral depths between those sorts of behavior and that treating them as equivalent was inherently problematic. Again I don't really know what to think of this, so I'm curious as to what people here think of that viewpoint and how it might feed into the main question if all sexes are similar in terms of overall abuse but, for example, violent physical abuse was weighted in one direction.",AskFeminists,1531367014,Khwarezm,5,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8y6cy2/which_sex_is_more_likely_to_be_the_victim_of/,2018-07-11

She likes playing video games but other players will make sexist jokes to her when she speaks on voice chat. She did a compilation of the messages she received and posted it on facebook.

She used the label ""autistic"" for them. The exact quote she said was ""this is what female gamers have to deal with from autistic people all the time"".

I responded saying ""I 'm appalled by what you had to go through but you shouldn't label them autistic. That's a negative stereotype. Many of my friends are autistic and don't behave this way at all"".

72,How to be pro-feminist when you can't agree with all feminists at the same time?,"Hi! Male here.

A while ago, I made a post here about my TERF girlfriend. The discussion opened my eyes and, after some reflection, I realized she wasn't exactly the nicest human being in the world. We discussed about a couple of things, including trans peoples rights, and now, she's my ex-girlfriend.

I'm just saying that because the fact that feminists have different views of transexuality brought me to a question I never even thought of.

I believe misogyny is one of the biggest problems in our world, that feminism is absolutely necessary and that it would be better if we all supported it. Since I'm a man, I believe the best I can do is listen to women and their thoughts on this matter rather than speaking \*for\* them (I just don't want to be a mansplainer asshole).

I'm pro feminism, but at the same time I'm aware that feminism (and feminists) comes in all shapes and sizes. Some, for example, say that women should wear how much make up they want because it's their choice, others say that women should avoid using make up because it might enforce beauty standards created by men ; some say porn is okay if the girl wants to do it it, others disagree because it's a toxic industry, etc. All I can do is listen to both sides and let them decide what's true and what's not. It's not my fight, it's not my cause, so I have to remain neutral.

But when it comes to relationships — in my case, a man and a woman — it's more difficult to be neutral about some stuff. For example: Some feminists say BDSM is wrong because it enforces and eroticizes oppression and gender violence, but others say BDSM is harmless when it happens between consenting adults. Now, imagine I date a woman who is really into BDSM and wants to do kinky things with me. I certainly will not judge her, but wouldn't I be irresponsible if I simply accepted her proposal without thinking of the oppressive cultural structure around it? Or, on the other hand, wouldn't I be underestimating her will and agency over her body and sexual life if I denied doing that stuff to her \*simply\* because other people say it's bad?

I mean... it's not for me to decide what's feminist and what's not, but when two opinions collide so strongly, at least one of them must me wrong... right?

In other words: \*How to be pro-feminist in situations that cause so much discussion and dissension among feminists?\* Or, if you prefer, \*how to be pro-feminist when you can't agree with all feminists at the same time?\*

75,Do feminists believe that hierarchies can be abolished/avoided?,"For context, I'm a male feminist, but I'm not well read on feminist theory.

I believe that hierarchies are inevitable. For instance, even if we worked at a job with no titles or established hierarchies, spontaneous hierarchies would develop. Certain people would have more sway than others and take ""leadership"" roles, even if they were not explicitly designated. I also believe that competence hierarchies are beneficial.

I *also* believe that social factors like poverty, sexism, and racism have large negative effects on the perception and development of competency. In other words, that patriarchy is maintained in part due to misperceptions in competency (elevating less competent men over more competent women), but that even if it reflected a true competency hierarchy, that it will change anyway as we continue to dismantle sexism.

I've seen it argued that feminists believe that all hierarchies can be abolished. Is this true, or a strawman?

87,I posted something on here last night about how my 11 year old nephew asked me if he was sexist. It had a decent amount of people weighing in and expressing their opinions. I deleted the post because it was becoming a Freshman Year Psych class. I have a question though regarding feminism as a whole.,"
- I'm not saying what feminist believe is wrong, or what I believe is right. Just like I hope you guys do with me and what I'm about to say and ask everyone. No need to call names or attack someone. We should be able to discuss this in a mature manner. But with that being said...

- My question is about Biases and my thoughts on a specific issue.

- When I posted yesterday about my nephew asking me if he was sexist. I honestly thought people on here were going to tell me how I can say to my nephew that no he isn't sexist at all. Not even remotely, he is making assumptions off of biases and generalizations he's seen and heard. I was going to tell him that it's okay because everyone does. Even when people say they don't, they do. We all have biases and generalizations we live with.

- So can someone explain to me the difference between having a bias and being sexist? Where is the line that seperate the two?

- If I have 2 friends who have a birthday tomorrow and I decide to get both of them a CD. So I decide to get here a Taylor Swift CD because I think girls like Taylor Swift. And get him a Kanye CD because I think men like Kanye. Does that make me sexist? Because we all have biases and we all think about stuff in a certain way from what we've seen and heard in the past. So if that happens, am I sexist? Where is the line that splits me having bias and it being okay. To the other side where my bias is no longer a bias, it's now sexist. Where is that line?

- I have one last question. I've been watching a lot protesters at a Trump Protest and other places on YouTube. I actually heard someone say 3 of the most rediculous things I have ever heard. 

1. All men are misogynistic.

2. All White people are racist.

3. It's impossible to be racist towards a white person. You can never be prejudice or racist at all toward white people.

- Do all feminists or women in general actually believe any of that? It's just her right? Or do some people feel that way also? Please share if you do. I won't get mad or yell or name call or anything like that. I'm just curious in why you would think any of those 3 were true.

- Thank you everyone for your time. I honestly don't mean any disrespect or have any hate for anyone. This is 100% based on my own curiousty. So please, be civil and and let's not resort any name calling. Thank you all again.

91,Are 'power' and 'powerlessness' better understood objectively or as a subjective experience?,"[This is a broad set of questions dealing with a general issue of power and subjectivity]

How should we measure power, powerlessness and equality?

Is it best to achieve equality via objective measures (i.e. equality of income) or is it better to focus on subjective experiences of power and powerlessness?

Is it possible to have a society in which men and women are objectively equal yet have radically different subjective experiences of power and powerlessness? (I think so, personally)

Is it possible to have a society in which both men and women are less objectively equal but feel more empowered than in a society of greater equality (of this I am less sure).

What do we do in a hypothetical situation where the two are mutually exclusive?

For example: iff it were true that treating men and women in the same way would leave one sex feeling more powerless than the other?

Doesn't the subjectivity of power make a massive mess of a very tidy and neat theory of oppression? 

Take the following example: 1920s man goes to work, earns money, wife stays at home and raises the kids. Standard traditional gender-roles blah blah.

Using objective measures of power, he has the power (for the most part) because he has the money and the earning.

Does it matter if, whilst this is going on, he has a subjective experience of total powerlessness over his life, whilst, in this example, she feels incredibly empowered (for whatever subjective reason).

Surely such an objective measure (like earnings) is way to clumsy and reductionist an approach to measuring equality?

To take another example: monogamy. It's an equal sacrifice, but only on paper, only objectively. The subjective experiences of monogamy vary wildly between individuals: some people gain a sense of power in having secured a life-partner, whilst other people may feel dis-empowered at their loss of sexual freedom. Subjectively: their sacrifice was not the same.

If we were to ignore subjective experience entirely, we could risk having a society where men and women are equal 'on paper' but either men or women, in general, have a disproportionate subjective experience of powerlessness.

Crucially, since subjective experiences of power vary so wildly, isn't it dangerous to objectify 'power' and 'powerlessness' then?

This issue is brought into stark relief in AskFeminist questions about BDSM: what objectively looks like a loss of power is (often, so I have read) subjectively experienced (by the submissive) as a sense of power.

The recurring trope of AskFeminism is ""Sure we earn more, but you get sex a lot easier"" - isn't this an issue relating to subjective experiences of power and powerlessness? [Generally] Men do not feel empowered by earning more (if it doesn't translate into their love/sex lives), women do not feel empowered by being sexually objectified. For men the greatest source of our subjective feelings of powerlessness is, I think, around our sex lives: from the male subjective viewpoint women really do have all the power over the main thing that matters to us.

Isn't objective analysis of gender equality so incredibly limited so long as it ignores subjective differences in male/female experience?

It is fairly normal for feminist texts critiqued aspects of the patriarchy based on it's exclusion of subjective female experience: why then do so many feminists seem so willing to completely disregard male subjective experiences?

Is it helpful for feminism to disregard male accounts of their own subjective experiences or interpersonal-dynamics?

So much of the MRA/Feminist war seems to be based on denying the subjective experience of the other: ""You're not a powerless, you're actually the powerful one"" - say both sides, and they both really feel it, really believe it.

Surely we can agree that, in order to make a harmonious society: both men and women need to appreciate the subjective experiences of 'the other'? In this case: both men and women, by-en-large, FEEL powerless in this society.",AskFeminists,1531659452,AdamGo86,8,3,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8z1j5r/are_power_and_powerlessness_better_understood/,2018-07-15

95,Resources for a male radfem?,"So, for the record, I'm a cishet man of South Asian descent. I've been reading quite a bit recently about feminism, gender issues, and social justice. I'm not super active in communities that discuss those things, but I think I'm relatively ""woke"". I realize that women are put through *unimaginable* amounts of shit by men and by a male-dominated society as a whole. I've often said that, if I were a woman, I would despise men.  

In particular, I do find things like radical feminism, political lesbianism, and separatist feminism quite interesting. And, honestly, I'm somewhat in favor of them. As a man, I think it's, generally, a good idea for the oppressors and the oppressed to be separate. So I'm kind of sympathetic to women disengaging from men - socially, politically, economically, sexually, etc. And I think men should disengage from women because, after centuries of oppression, they've done enough damage and should back off. The only thing women need men for is sperm, and that can be provided via sperm donation. But I fervently believe that women would be better off if they separated from men as much as possible.   

I don't really know what to call this belief system. It's a bit of an oxymoron for a man to believe in separatist feminism. But is there a name for a belief system in which men agree with separatist feminism and try to accomplish the same goals from the men's side?

""mommy culture"" - the idea that children always need their mothers more so then fathers, wich is especially not true with boys who need a male figure to learn from.

hitting or putting your hands on someone thinking they wont hit back because you are a girl.

-women tend to be the biggest gossipers that like to tear others down. I worked in mental health and even the female nurses would constantly talk shit and belittle patients who could not leave so they were subjected to how ever the nurses treated them.

-expecting men to protect them after they start an issue with someone, even if it means bodily harm to that man.

being naturaly salty and bitter about men even without cause. Then treat them according to how they feel about them. Even to people they dont know.

102,"Is ""crossing the street"" racist?","I consider myself a feminist but have trouble dealing with the following point and I wonder if it is a false dichotomy.

Given that a randomly selected man of certain races are more likely to commit a crime than a randomly selected white man, is it racist to cross the street or otherwise take measures to protect your body?

Even if the high amount of crime is due to historic oppression, the fact remains that violemt crime is committed at a higher per capita rate in certain racial groups. So it seems reasonable to protect your body in ways that are discriminatory.

On the other hand, people are individuals and deserve to be judved not as members of a group but due to their moral character. But I do not have access to the moral character of a random stranger.

I guess this is similar to the racial profiling problem.

My thought process is that for young girls (at least in American culture) getting their ears pierced *can be* (but isn't necessarily) a sort of mini-right-of-passage as one of the first things they can do to dress like an adult. And if I had a daughter, I wouldn't want to deny her that experience. However, I've never met a woman (or anyone for that matter) who said they felt that way or thought it was a big deal. Do you?

110,I have a story I'd like to share and have some input on...,"So here's my side of the story (25M)

I move to a new town, and go to the farmer's market with a few neighbors. One of the neighbors seems kind of cool but the other seems a bit high energy for me. I'm a chill guy. 

So the more relaxed one and I are talking about art, and what kind of stuff we've done. I show her some flowers I've drawn, a few mountains, then switch to a sketch of me doing some nude modeling. It's all penis-less quick 1-minute sketches. We talk some more about it and the hyper one pokes her head over my shoulder and takes a look. 

Okay no problem. Then she digs through her phone to find some pictures of her topless just standing in front of a mirror to show me. Okay. Weird, but whatever. I'm not here to judge. It's a new town, and a fairly liberal one at that. 

So we finish walking around, and the hyper one invites me on a hike. I'm new and don't have any friends, so why not. The second we get in the car she asks me what kind of guy I like, and starts really prying into me. I slowly but fairly reluctantly say that I have a type (small blonde girls) and she kind of starts, it almost felt like... maybe trying to change my opinion or something? Telling me I was being kind of objectifying. I say that I have a type and I know it and that's okay. Outward beauty is only a small portion of something bigger, and that's okay, but it's definitely an essential part.

She says something about how small her feet are at one point, and then says ""well you know what they say about small feet"", then smiles and literally winks at me. I freeze literally in my tracks for a second, freaked out, try to change the topic as fast as I can, and say ""well, idk. that's about dudes. Obviously it has nothing to do with boobs or anything"" because she was clearly being sexual and I had zero interest in talking about the size of her vagina. Not very smooth of me, but whatever. She smiles and starts talking about her boobs for like 3 minutes. Clearly a big mistake. 

She then goes on and talks about nothing but how she hasn't had sex for like 2 years for about an hour. I try to steer the conversation towards wholesome things like my mom, etc... She says she doesn't like hookups, and I agree, but say it's not probably for the same reason. She asks why, so I tell her that ""Sex with new people is just unfulfilling. It requires intimacy and connection and I'm not really comfortable with people right away."" She keeps probing, so I go into some more detail, and she just asks question after question. Then she starts telling me about her rape fantasy and how she's only attracted to assholes and on and on... 

Then we keep going after climbing a tree for a bit, and she keeps just like stopping in the middle. I'm super uncomfortable and trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. One time she stops and I do a bro-ish butt-slap and say ""come on, let's get going. I don't feel good and want to leave."" Then she turns around, smiles, and says ""don't touch my butt without asking"". 

Immediately I feel awful and realized I totally crossed a boundary and it's probably not okay to treat girls like bros. When I want to get going somewhere, I can't just do that. I apologize profusely and she says it's fine. 

We finally leave and get back to our place and I go inside and shower. 

Then, after a few hours she asks for a ride to someone's house at like 8 at night. I try to come up with some excuses, but I've already said how much I love driving and how I don't have anything going on that night. So I go. She invites me in and starts making me dinner. Okay, whatever. Then it's like 10 o'clock and she asks for a massage like 3 times. Finally, after the 3rd time I give in and she stands there and gives me a massage but complains about how it isn't doing the trick. I say that's because you have to lay down. I can't get enough pressure in, but idk about that. 

So I stop and say this isn't going to work and try to leave. She keeps stretching and complaining about her back and asks for another massage over and over and says she'll lay down on the couch. 

Okay whatever. 

The whole time the girl is talking super fast and going on and on... at some point later she starts showing pictures of her when she was younger because she's still on this ""what is my ideal type thing"" and talking about how she used to have an eating disorder. I tell her she looks healthy now, and not to worry about it. She keeps scrolling through her phone and finds a bunch of nudes and shows me for a bit, and I, trying to move the conversation away, ask if she has anything artsy instead? We do this for like a minute. 

Okay. Weird day. The girl is super hyperactive, I fucked up once, and she's talking really fast and I'm confused the whole time and kind of uncomfortable. But nothing happened, and I was clear from the start that nothing would happen (after she starting the day off by being so hypersexual). 

I move on and decide not to talk to her again because she's kind of weird and doesn't seem like she'd make a good friend because it seems like she's not interested in just being friends. 

---

Her side of the story: 

""I saw you guys doing that, and did this burlesque thing one time, so I wanted to show you pictures"" 

""You made a comment about my boobs and it made me really uncomfortable"" 

""I was really not okay with you touching my butt.""

""I wasn't comfortable with you giving me a massage.""

""I wasn't comfortable with you seeing pictures of me."" 

""I think you objectify women and don't know how to respect them.""

""I'm actually bipolar and going through new meds and am definitely in a hypomanic phase.""

""I don't know, the whole thing was a big blur.""

""I take a lot of responsibility because I could see how a lot of things I did could be misconstrued""

""I wasn't comfortable hearing you talk about sex.""

---

Now... that's really all I've got to work with because I'm not really comfortable talking to her right now, and I don't think she is either. 

I really struck a nerve here and don't know what to do. A big part of me is currently thinking like this:

""What? You weren't comfortable with a massage, why did you ask me to give you one like 10 times at 11 o'clock at night"" 

""You weren't comfortable hearing me talk about sex, why did you ask me a thousand questions about it and not talk about anything else?"" 

""You weren't comfortable with me making a comment about your boobs, why make weird sexual remarks and wink at me?"" 

""You didn't want me to touch your butt, stop walking in front of me and stopping to bend over every 5 minutes for an hour. Fucking move your god damn butt. I'm tired of walking into it. It makes me feel like a fucking creep."" 

""You weren't comfortable with me seeing pictures of you naked, stop literally shoving my face in them twice in one day""

""You think I objectify women, stop asking me what my ideal body type is?"" 

""You don't want me to make comments about your body, stop showing me a thousand pictures of you and talking about how you photoshop them to make you look smaller. I literally have no option to talk about the only subject you want to bring up.""

---

But another part of me is like ""Wow... holy fuck. This girl is really uncomfortable. And she's my neighbor. What the fuck do I do? How do I navigate this whole thing without being an asshole? I really don't want to offend anyone, and I kind of think this girl was having a hypomanic episode and now regrets it, and I don't know how to be supportive of her and help myself live in a healthy dynamic community."" 

I don't feel comfortable or safe in my own house anymore, and I kind of feel like I'm being made into an aggressor when I really don't think I was being one.

However... I'm totally open to changing my mindset. Maybe I'm kind of a toxic asshole? I'm not sure... So I'm looking for some advice, input, help on this whole thing.

111,"What, if not *just* gender equality, is feminism really about?","Upon recently discovering this sub I was happy to have found a place that might help me better understand feminism beyond the basic principles, to learn more about what it means to be feminist and to read opinions from people who identify as such. In short, I was hoping to find a somewhat informed and balanced view on what feminism ""really"" stands for, apart from the general pursuit of women's rights/female empowerment that many people associate it with. It's been my understanding that feminism is, at its core, about gender equality.

However, I've been surprised/disappointed to find such a lack of nuance in many of the views and opinions expressed in this sub, that I've started wondering if what I thought feminism is about was just a naive or watered-down interpretation.

I get it, people are angry with the status quo and most of history, and rightly so. But with some posters seemingly advocating an 'us vs. them' stance, or outright justifying misandry, to me, it seems either shortsighted, counterproductive and/or harmful to (what I thought was) the objective: gender equality.

So: if this basic understanding of mine is limited, uninformed or wrong, can you explain to me what else feminism aims to achieve than ""just"" gender equality, and how?

112,If the end goals of Feminism could be reached (and not taken away) tomorrow what would they be?,"It seems like ideologies can occasionally have no end, they always find something new to accomplish.  I see this as potentially a problem because eventually you can get to the point where you are just plugging holes that don't need to be filled.  This can be counterproductive and impact the lawful freedom of others.

For example the American abolitionists ended slavery in America.  There were other problems related to race in America, but slavery was no longer legal and you didn't need to end it.

Then there is Feminism.  In the United States, women got the vote, legal abortion, equal pay laws, land ownership, husbands aren't like your father legally speaking, and generally women can do whatever they want (they face adversity, but the best women succeed despite it).

When does it end?  Equal outcomes in all employment categories, including income?  Equal representation in government, the work place, etc?  Are you expecting men to treat you the same as they treat other men? 

It seems like the end game is already here.  You're nearly to the finish line in the West.  What is next? Will it ever end?

121,Thoughts on a situation I found myself in recently,"Recently found myself in the following situation and wasn't sure how to behave:

At a party in a big venue with lots of people I was on my way outside for some air with two guys I barely knew. As we moved through the crowd I noticed that that one of the guys was acting strange but i didn't realize what he was up to at first. Then suddenly a girl turns around, looks at me kind of hurt and I realize that the guy probably just grabbed her butt and reached around me so it seemed like i did the grabbing. I felt embarassed, was kind of overwhelmed, so i turned around and followed the guys outside. Now, I have never touched a girl inappropiately and guys harrassing girls pisses me off massively in general, so I was really uncomfortable with the thought that that girl now thought of me as a guy who grabbed her. We go outside and the guy starts bragging about how many girls he touched on the way. I tell him that that's not cool with me and he replies something like ""for that not being cool with you, a whole lot of girls thought it was you who touched them"", chuckles and proceeds to explain to me how he always reached around me like I had suspected. He still seems to think that he pulled a great little stunt so i tell him i don't find this funny in the slightest, that he shouldn't have done it and then i leave. 

How should I have acted when the girl turned around, thinking it was me who grabbed her? Should I have told her that it wasn't me? I wasn't 100 percent sure she thought so and I also didn't want to make this about me, as she was the victim and not me.

I'm Canadian and, as most other Canadians who see this post might remember, we had some interesting PSAs through the '80s until the mid-00s (CCA and Heritage Moments anyone? lol) that varied from actually being decent PSAs that covered important topics to just being really silly or really bad. We started talking about the fact that PSAs aren't really a thing anymore because they're silly and weren't exactly effective at much, but if they were still a thing nowadays then what sorts of topics would we like to see covered. And then that got me thinking about feminism and other related social issues.  


I know this is a silly question but I thought it could potentially be fun to talk about lol, so my question is basically the title; if you were to create some short (like 30 seconds to a minute) PSAs to air on TV, are there any topics you'd like to cover?

Personally, some topics I'd like to see covered are body image and beauty standards, media literacy, consent, healthy ways to express emotion (especially one for young boys,) and a few other things that aren't coming to mind at the moment lol. I understand that PSAs aren't exactly the greatest things for explaining complicated social issues, and they can be pretty silly and overall not do much, but they can be a good way to get people thinking about things and to start conversations about them lol.

I have also heard some feminists support female sex workers, claiming that it empowers women. Those seem entirely contradictory. Maybe they are coming from different groups of people, but the issue of objectification of women seems fairly critical to feminism, so I would guess that there are at least some feminists that are against the objectification of women and support women in sex work. Is this a common view? How do those work together? It sees to me that things like stripping, pornography, and prostitution fundamentally sexually objectify the sex workers and directly contribute to the objectification of women in general. Given the size of the sex industry and the nature of it (where the viewers/participants seek it out specifically for their sexual gratification and it being overt and explicit, unlike something like advertising), I would think that it is at least one of the leading causes of the objectification of women. I don't see how someone who is against women being objectified can support people directly contributing to it. 

Maybe someone could try to make the argument that it's not the sex worker's fault for what others think or do based on what she did, but I don't think that would make much sense. Is there any realistic expectation that her viewers/participants wouldn't objectify her at all? Maybe it's possible for people to not objectify her for a few select cases, such as camming or prostitution if the viewers/participants feel like they actually get to know the sex worker. Even then, I'm not sure if all objectification is removed since they are still just using her for sexual gratification. Other things like pornography seem like the pinnacle of sexual objectification, and there would be no expectation that the viewers wouldn't simply objectify the sex workers. If there isn't any expectation that the viewers/participants could avoid objectifying the sex worker for what she does, I don't see how her work or supporting her work would be justifiable.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding or overlooking something. I'm curious to hear what someone else thinks.",AskFeminists,1531888354,GrayGlory111,13,2,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8zscsy/how_does_the_issue_of_objectifying_women_relate/,2018-07-18

131,Asking views on my girlfriend's situation,"Okay, this will be long, please bear with me.

I(23) met my girlfriend(20) Dec of 2016 through Tinder, we had a ONS (she was a virgin, I wasn't). Throughout the Christmas break, we kept infrequent contact. 
On early Jan of 2017, we met again to hook up. According to her, I acted like a dick that time cuz I was rushing away after we did it (I had class, i told her beforehand), while she wanted me to stay longer. She met another guy through Tinder that night, wherein she slept with him. 

A few days after, we still met up 2-3x a week until she invited me to her bday on jan 15.(This is a bit of a segueway, she posted a picture of a hotel room on Jan 15, she told me that it was her family having a staycation at the hotel, but it turns out it was a picture of when she was with her hookup after meetinng me) She confessed to me that she started liking me. I told her I was a bit blindsided by her confession and wanted to take things slow. We kept meeting regularly, 2-3x a week at this point and I started liking her and took her out on dates. 

Late Jan, she told me she was going clubbing with her highschool friends on Feb 3, asking if it was cool with me, I said sure it's definitely cool with me. So the night of the clubbing, she was texting erratically, with lots of typos and rushed texting, but  didn't think much of it and I slept. The day after, she started messaging me late (11 noon) and telling me how her night went. I didn't think anything odd about it and kept on. A few months after, she confessed to me that a trusted guy friend of her coerced her into sex, I was devastated with the news and consoled her. 


However, inconsistensies popped up in her story and I got suspicious. I did some digging and found out that the guy wasn't really her friend. I dumped her through text and she told me that I needed to know the truth. She was keeping contact with the guy through january and when I told her I wasnt sure about how I felt about her confession, she agreed to go out with the guy. 

However, after that, there were 3 weeks in between that I developed feelings and took her on dates. She told me what really happened that night (feb 3). Mid jan, he told keisuke(the other guy) about me, how I was a really sweet guy and she liked being with me. He told her that she should give him a chance. He was mad and told her he was leaving the country on early feb, he wanted to meet her one last time before leaving, she said yes but no sex, he agreed. They were supposed to meet up at a mall at around 10pm and she was late, so he got mad at her. After that, they went to the club only to find out tha she didnt bring her I.D.. He was mad so he started walking away. She felt bad so she followed him. He told her to get into his car and she obeyed. After that they went to his condo wherein she(allegedly) tried to calm him down and apologize. However he was raising his voice and approached her. He then placed his hands underneath her panties and then they had sex. She told me that she felt coerced, that she didnt want and enjoy it. However, she also told me that he was far better in bed when we had arguments. My issue is, she clearly broke my trust when she lied about who she went with. Whatever happened afterwards, it doesnt change the fact that she cheated. Am I wrong in feeling like this? I have argued so much with her about this and made her cry a lot, I just cant release this pain and anger, help.

All accounts in this story were told by her, I tried keeping as accurate as possible to her recounting, hence the length.


Tl;dr: First month of seeing a girl, she lied about going to a club (told me it was with her friends, turns out it was with her previous ONS). She told me it was coercing and she was sorry. I feel that it was cheating about her lying who she was with. This has been a source of fights and I've said really hurtful things that have made her cry.

152,"Getting Married! Looking for Thoughts on Last Names, Titles, and Patriarchy.","Hello! 

I am recently engaged and I have been thinking a lot about names, becoming a family, signifying our unity, all that jazz. I have lots and lots of time to make a final decision (2.5 years), but I’m not sure that I want to the be only one of us to make a decision. 

I have said since the beginning that I will be keeping my own last name and he has never once argued against it or made even a slight indication that he cares one way or the other. If anything, he would probably question it if I did start talking about changing my name because I’m feminist AF and he would find it strange lol 

Now that the engagement is official and marriage is forthcoming, I’ve been thinking a little more deeply about it than simply “I like my name/identity and don’t want to change it, also patriarchy”. I’ve been leaning toward keeping my name legally, but tacking his onto the end of my name socially… basically, I’d go through life introducing myself as “Ms. or Mrs. MyName-HisName”. Still haven’t decided on whether I’d like to use “Mrs.”, given the patriarchal connotations of the term. Most likely not. (On that note: would it be weird to call myself ""Ms. MyName-HisName?)

The more I think about it, the more I’d like us to seriously discuss the idea of him *also* taking my last name on. I won’t push for it either way, but the way I see it, we are both becoming members of one anothers’ families and we are becoming a family unit ourselves (regardless of the fact we are not having kids). Part of my reasoning for wanting to tack his name on is because I want my name to reflect that I am part of his family (and also I like his name lol). Our names actually sound quite nice together, but only when structured “MyName-HisName”, not the other way around haha

I want to mull it over a bit more myself and hear a bit more about other peoples’ thoughts and experiences before I bring the topic up to him, since we do have a lot of time and I consider it a pretty big ask for him to buck tradition and take on the potential social backlash that can come along with that sort of thing (not in our families or social group, but out in the world in general). I won’t be hurt or offended if he chooses not to, but I would be over the moon and incredibly proud if he did.

I'm interested in hearing other feminists' takes on the different options I've been mulling (no name change, me hyphenating, both hyphenating) as well as your thoughts on the use of ""Mrs."" if I do choose to hyphenate.

This process is exacerbated under our mass media and capitalistic dominant framework. 

So I am wondering about some comments on this and whether this is a stance purported or refuted in mainstream feminist theory. I know that radfem (which is fringe) is absolutely against sex work and pornography however their entire framework, well, it's radical.

But I really wanted to vent this and ask for advice. And get a female perspective.

I was at a bar a week ago. I was trying to have a good time but my ex of two weeks was there so I was sitting a bit depressed at the bar.

Three girls come up. I know one of them. She works a the gym I work out. She flirted with me a couple of times. But I am not interested. 

They were drunk and being obnoxious. One start pulling my shirt. I said I wasn't in the mood. They buy me a shot. We talk.

They start shouting. One tells me: don't be a pussy. Again one is pulling my shirt forcefully. 

The gym girl is grabbing my crotch. Untying my belt. 

I was so done at this point. I pushed one of them hard to get put of there. So she flies and falls hitting her head. I guessed I felt ridiculed.

I felt like shit and just went out of there.

How do I handle these kinds of situations?

8,How should I unlearn the paranoia I developed from reading into feminist opinion?,"Disclaimer: I couldn’t think of a relevant title that wasn’t alarmist, so I hope the mods can allow this or offer a rewording that may be friendlier if this must be reposted?

A lot of my education and encounter around feminism has been through editorials and opinions directed at men, usually pertaining to how men harass, belittle, and harm. Eventually I started to internalize and believe I was part of the problem, and that even though I don’t recall participating in those actions, I’ve become extremely careful/paranoid that I would be at risk of causing those actions (i.e. “I don’t want to be that guy thoughts”).

When I look for ways to hypothetically look up how maybe I won’t be that problem, it’s been more or less met with an understandably combative/irritated response of, “if it’s not talking about you, then piss off.” But that’s the problem, I don’t know if it doesn’t talk about me because I still feel as if I’m going to be at risk of being the problem. As a result, I’ve built an emotional barrier over the years that could prevent any kind of female interaction that could cause me to cause or get into trouble, resulting in me being capable of rational socialization, but still incapable of emotional specialization (ie, I can’t/fear relating to women on an emotional level out of fear of becoming abusive). 

Asking here because the few feminist friends I trusted have unfriended me over this or told me to go to a therapist without listening.

17,My Problem with Feminism Is That It Doesn't Care About Men - Can You Change My Mind?,"I'll make it as easy as possible and list out a few examples here, where I'll bring up a women's issue (which, like you, I want to see fixed, believe it or not) and then an equivalent men's issue that's never talked about by the same people bringing up said women's issue. Feel free to just contest those, if you'd like. Or if you'd rather tell me why my view is scewed and that what I'm saying isn't even true, I'll still listen.

I'm here with an open mind (that doesn't mean I'll agree with everything, or even anything, everyone says) and am not just here to shit on feminists. Just wanna see if anyone can leave me walking away from this with a changed mind, if anyone's up to it. Bonus points if we can all have a civilized discussion.

Examples of women's issues often talked about with equivelant men's issues getting swept under the rug:

- I always hear about models and barbies that teach girls they need to starve themselves. But I've never heard these same people complain about HeMan, Action Man, Hulk Holgan, Arnold (and pretty much every role model I had growing up) *all* having physiques that can only be attained through years of steroid abuse. Why not? How is steroid abuse less of an issue than anorexia?

- I hear about the negative way in which society teaches girls to behave (being ""ladylike,"" being the one who gets saved from a burning building (rather than the one doing the saving), needing to dress a certain way so men can oggle them, etc.). But I never hear about the negative ways in which society teaches men how to behave (not allowed to ask for help or show sadness, have to be ""tough"" and get in stupid fights, have to like sports instead of art, can't exhibit any traditionally ""feminine"" traits or interests, such as a love of animals other than big, fearsome dogs, or a tendency to be quiet and soft spoken, or even having long hair and, depending on where you grow up, a taste for fashion).

- I hear about ways in which female victims of abuse receive less-than-ideal treatment (being questioned too much, nobody believing them, etc.). But I never hear those same people speak about the issues revolving around male abuse (a lack of (or even *no*) male abuse shelters in the entire country, society's lack of care about the issue (a woman hitting a man in public being more socially acceptible than a man hitting a woman, both in reality and on television)).

I'm certainly for fixing all of the above female issues. But I don't want to stop there. My experience (which, I'll admit, may or may not be representative of these movements as a whole) is that both feminists and MRAs tend to focus on their gender's problems (obviously), while giving the other gender's issues less, or even no, time in the spotlight.

This, to me, screams sexism. Making a bigger deal about male or female suffering, to me, says something (negative) about a movemeny. Is my perception wrong? Has every feminist I've talked to just so happened to be an outlier? If not, why is women dealing with the above issues more important than men dealing with them?

And, before anyone assumes otherwise, I have the exact same issue with MRAs. It seems to me like they only care about half the population. I'll never identify as an MRA for the same reason I'll never identify as a feminist. They seem like closeted (if that) sexists, as it's clear their agenda also revolves around propping up one sex while leaving the other to stew in their misery.

I have my reasons. Currently, I am in the midst of another dry spell that is at least a year long at this point. Unfortunately, my dry spells can often become droughts and I am a person that enjoys sex quite a bit and desires companionship.

I've returned to the dating scene but have had no luck. I have an active social life, but it isn't the kind where I go to bars or clubs or places where women might accept being approached by men. I draw a firm delineation between my work and street life and my romantic life. Meaning I don't pursue women romantically on the street or at work. I make friends and I will make small talk with strangers on the bus or at the dog park, but I make sure to give them the space they need. 

Tried online dating again but it has been a bust. Tinder and Bumble are useless for me as I am horribly average and have shit texting skills. OKC has led to two dates in the past six months that didn't work. They were not horrible, but both cases the women decided I was not a good fit. 

I still want sex though, but currently the only ethical and legal means I have to have anything even remotely resembling sex is a sex doll/bot.

Do you agree?","[Here's](https://quillette.com/2018/06/21/a-literary-inquisition-how-novelist-steven-galloway-was-smeared-as-a-rapist-even-as-the-case-against-him-collapsed/) an article on what happened to him. Its a little long. But, I encourage people to read it. It is quite the story. 

**But, tldr:** 

Steven Galloway is a Canadian author. He became the head of the creative writing department in the University of British Columbia. 

An anonymous professor tells professor Chelsea Rooney that she was raped by him. Rooney begins to spread this story. A police report isn't filed. 

The university hires retired Supreme Court Justice Mary Ellen Boyd to investigate the claims. She has a history of investigating sexual abuse allegations. 

She discovers that Galloway and the anonymous professor had been in a consensual years long extramarital affair. She determines that the alleged date of the rape is suspect. Both of them had attended a university function shortly after its supposed to have happened. Also, there's evidence that Galloway was meeting with students while it was supposedly occurring. 

What's more, text messages reveal that Galloway and the anonymous professor continued to have a very close and trusting relationship for years after the rape would have occurred. Years later, the anonymous professor even asked Galloway to file a complaint on her behalf of sexual abuse by yet another professor. 

Boyd files her report with the university. However, by this point, the story of the rape has been spread on social media by the other professors. It is argued that women should be believed. Doubting the story makes one a rape apologist. 

The university fires Galloway and publicly accuses him of rape. Following the universty's lead, other media organizations spread this allegation. Galloway is found guilty in the court of public opinion. He is vilified and encouraged to commit suicide fellow professors and writers. 

After a long legal battle, he was just awarded $167,000 from the university. The court determined that they violated his privacy and engaged in reputational damage. 

Those who accuse him on social media are unapologetic. Many continue to hold that doubting the allegations makes you a rape apologist.

So, from what I understand, sexy women in video games is not something feminist  are against, the main problem with video games (and other media) is with lazy writing when it comes to female characters and other groups of people.

41,"Have any of you watched the anime ""Haikyuu!!!""? As a feminist, how do you feel about the female character(s) and/or their portrayals? Is the show still watchable?","Haikyuu is an anime about a men's high school volleyball team. I fucking adore it, but I find myself unsure about recommending it because I can't get a good grasp of its level of sexism. During most of the first season, the only frequent female character is someone who helps the team do things like taking notes and handing out towels/water. Although her character isn't drawn as some overly sexed up doll with large hanging boobs, she is considered to be very attractive and most of the interactions with her are with two of the team's womanizers who frequently try to hit on her (and she subsequently turns them down or ignores them). There's an episode or two involving the women's volleyball team where the characters have personalities and aren't sexualized, but it's not a big part of the show.

Does the show seem to perpetuate toxic masculinity to a damaging degree? Are the portrayals of women, while understandably sidelined (it's a men's volleyball team), too negative to be watchable? Are the interactions with the club's manager amusing or annoying?

I'd also be interested in resources about female representations in media and common toxic tropes.

45,Something that hasn't really been discussed with the hindsight of #MeToo: Celebrity nude leaks,"Back in 2014, the massive leak of nude celebrity photos, dubbed ""Celebgate"" by the media and, of course, the much less tasteful ""Fappening"" by Reddit.

Jennifer Lawrence took the, what was considered to be radical by Twitter and Reddit, stance of calling the incident  a ""sex crime"" and a ""sexual violation"", adding, ""anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offense and you should cower with shame"".  Another victim of the crime, Emily Ratajkowski, stated ""A lot of people who were victims of \[the hack\] said anyone who looks at these pictures should feel guilty, but I just don't think that's fair. I'm not sure that anyone who Googles it is necessarily a criminal. I think the people who stole the photos are."" 

The hackers themselves, the ones who were caught, received a mere 16 to 18 months in prison.

This brings me to my question, regarding the side of the scandal that did not get addressed much outside of that particular Lawrence interview. The simple ""nettizens"", the receiving end. 

While it is certainty a morally wrong act, should the people on Twitter, Facebook, and private messages who share these photos, not the hackers themselves, be charged with a sex crime? What about people who merely view the photos?  Is there morally a difference between the ignorant teenager who views these types of photos and the people who did the leaking?

48,"BDSM and Feminism, can it work?","I’ve had some issues being both a feminist and someone who can enjoy BDSM as well.

I’d say a lot of the time, as soon as the topic of BDSM in the bedroom comes up, it goes the following way:

1. Tell man about BDSM interest, specifically being submissive
2. Explain that this is IN THE BEDROOM ONLY and I do not want any role play or controlling nature outside of sexually. 
3. They say they understand
4. Proceed to say shit like “how about I just make you do _____”, “who’s in control here, remember, babe?”, “why don’t you wear this like daddy likes?” Ick, gross. 

Anyone else have problems like this? Obviously I’m glad these guys show their colors so I can avoid them, but seriously how hard is it to understand I expect to be treated equally AND like to be dominated in the bedroom.

49,Where do you draw the line at forgiveness/redemption?,"In a not too long ago post, I was debating the morality of viewing leaked nudes vs sharing them.

In my personal view, I conceeded that feeling guilt, mentally replacing that moment of voyeuristic joy with well deserved guiltful shame, was enough to redeem oneself; with the promise to do better.

I felt that sharing the links was a bit grayer and depends on the intention. Ignorant apathy or wanting to hurt the victim? That's not even getting to the leakers themselves, which I felt deserved the title of sexual criminals.

Now that's just the actions committed from being a computer screen.

Sexual harassment is still very prevalent in our society, and seems to result in more public terminations with celebrities than it used to. But on a ""closer to the ground, average Joe"" level what if the person who committed it genuinely feels remorseful? Do they deserve to be called out terminated from their position years later? I'd say ""no"", but is there a factor I'm perhaps not taking into consideration?

Then there's the physical stuff. I'm personally not willing to forgive these for the most part.

Sexually assault, domestic violence, rape, alln appear to be unforgivable acts, with no possible redemption. Rape especially.

Again, am I wrong in this conviction? Is there something I'm overlooking?

However, I grew up and currently live in one of the poorest areas of Baltimore where I have had to learn to at least fake outer toughness in a lot of situations as a survival mechanism.

Not being “masculine enough” for a man here can be seen as a sign of weakness, which in turn opens you up to physical harm and ostracization by others. I don’t really care about the latter part, but failing to engage in certain toxic behaviors such as aggressive conflict resolution (fighting, cursing, posturing, etc.) can make you a prime target for serious violence. I’m not talking about, like, the suburban high school bullying or peer pressure you see on TV either, but kids/adults who will jump or mug you at moment’s notice if they sense that you won’t/can’t fight back.

86,"Thoughts on Women (who don't have sex guilt), that enjoy rape fantasies?","I stumbled upon this article here: https://culturalanalysis.net/2018/06/28/why-feminists-enjoy-rape-fantasies/?epc_purge_single=1

that notes among other things ""According to a survey conducted by Bivona &amp; Critelli (2009) 62% of women admitted having a rape dream or fantasy at least once in their lifetime."" and that's those that admitted to it.

""91% of women in the survey had fantasies that were entirely or partly sexually satisfying.""

""several studies have shown that women who had rape fantasies scored lower than other women on sex guilt (Shulman &amp; Horne 2006; Strassberg &amp; Lockerd 1998). It was also found that women with high sex guilt have fewer sexual fantasies in general""

"" This suggests that rape fantasies are not a result of sexual repression but are positively correlated with sexual freedom and empowerment. Shulman &amp; Horne (2006) observe that prevalence of eroticised rape fantasy is significantly higher among more empowered ""

I had always heard that rape fantasies were because of Hollywood social programming via male dominated mediums (such as from feminist Naomi Wolf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or1_13OZhh0)

If women enjoy it so much, is it then bad, it follows, to ban it from porn? Or to criticize it in porn? Doesn't this also lay a brick that undermines the blank slate theory in some way?

Our current government even proclaimis itself to be the first ever “feminist government”.

Recently the government proposed a new bill that would force corporations to implement gender quotas that would ensure that at least 40% of the board of executives of any company are women. Not meeting the quotas would warrant a fine of 250,000 – 5,000,000 SEK. 

I am completely baffled that such quotas would even considered to be put into law.  It is obvious that there is a severe lack of competent women in these fields. Not only are these quotas outright discrimination against the deserving men who dedicate their lives for their work and whom would not be given their fair chance of success, but it must also be detrimental both for the corporations and the economy as a whole when such highly important positions are actively filled with less competent and less productive individuals.

115,I have a question.,"To preference this, I’m a 25 year old white guy. Why is the “fight for equality” still a thing when all I’ve seen is a fight for only yourself? I’m not saying yourself as women, but as “you”. Why not truly for your children, or at least the next generation if you don’t have kids. I don’t have kids, but mainly I’m speaking of selective service. I had to sign up just to go to college, and that was kind of a turn off. Knowing that I had to join or not get an education, where as girls could go to college and never worry. This was back in 2011 when we were still seriously at war. I saw no women fighting for equality to put their daughter’s lives on the line, but saw many fighting to get respect for abortion. Why is a guy’s life less than a woman’s? I’ve had this debate with three sociology professors and one ethic’s professor, and all I’ve ever gotten was a “let’s end selective service”. That’s not realistic nor feasible, because even in peace the government believe shit can hit the fan and we need bodies in boots. So, I guess my point is why is it that male politicians and female politicians either see men as more expendable than women, or more of a true fighting force in a rush. I’m not trying to start shit, and I’m truly not trying to be an ass. I seriously want to know why no one is fighting for equality in secondary education requirements; since it basically means that the government sees us as not equal to fight in a serious rush for troops!

She's really plays up her sexuality, or, in less PR-friendly terms, designed to attract the male gaze.

Bayonetta was created by a man, but her designer was a female. One producer said ""The designer who created Bayonetta is a female herself, so the costumes and accessories show the touch and detail that could only come from a woman’s sensibility.""

But having her be designed by a woman also seems like it could interpreted as a smokescreen; a way to deflect feminist criticism. Obviously, this character was designed and behaves in such a way so as to attract male players with her sexuality. Eye candy. 

Her defenders cite the fact that she enjoys her sexuality, being free to behave as she pleases. And there's no doubt she's powerful, slaying her way through angels and dragons and demons and dragons demons like it's nothing.

But I can't help but feel there is no strong defense of the series as not sexist. Every defense I've read just seems like insincere deflection from people who seem embarrassed to admit why they like her.

136,"The ""privilege"" of expressing offense","Been mulling this one over for a couple of days now. Over the past week, I've seen a handful of feminists here acknowledge that ""female privilege"" is, in fact, a thing (something I've always believed). In the past, most of the time I've brought it up, it was met with ""no, it's not female privilege, it's benevolent sexism"", and in many cases that's a fair assessment, but not in all of them.

One in particular sticks out for me, because it (possibly) has pretty sweeping ramifications: the privilege of expressing offense. Women, generally, are allowed to be offended by affronts to their gender. Expressing that they are upset or offended doesn't get them labeled as ""less of a woman"" at all. Women can call out sexist remarks or express anger at sexist policies, and while they're not always taken seriously, I'm not sure we could say that anyone looks down on a woman who speaks up for feeling how she does. Misogynistic men may regard them as whiners, but at least most other women would applaud them.

And I know this wasn't always true: in the early days of feminism, I'm pretty sure women paid pretty dearly at times for saying their piece. But it's 2018 now, and a lot has changed (not enough, but let's be honest, a lot).

Contrast this with men: if a sexist remark is made about men, and a man speaks up about it, he's usually met with the charge of being ""butthurt"", oversensitive, unable to ""take it like a man"", or just making a big deal out of nothing, *both by women and by other men*. I'm going to point out here that the people reacting this way to men expressing offense are *generally not feminists* - feminists are actually the one demographic who seem most willing to take what these men say seriously (that said, even feminists sometimes screw this up). But overall, in society at large (which is largely neither feminist nor thoughfully ""gender-egalitarian""), men are looked down on for complaining about their own gendered issues or expressing dissatisfaction with the role they're expected to fit into - rejecting the role is seen as dereliction of duty. This expectation of accepting insults or affronts to one's gender is one that women don't really face, at least not nearly to the degree that men do. This is toxic masculinity being enforced and perpetuated; when men complain about gendered issues, society at large [fruitcakes the hell out of them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8jvvxi/why_is_saying_men_are_trash_deemed_ok_even/dz3achp/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_Stavrogin78)


I've actually tried to dress this one up as ""benevolent sexism"", but I really can't see any way this particular advantage women have can be traced to any negative or infantilizing perception of women; it seems to be very firmly rooted in the expectations of the male gender role alone.

The first objection I'd anticipate to this would be the idea that women have much more to complain about, and that men complaining about gendered issues sound like spoiled rich kids. Which they sometimes are, I suppose. But then, it occurred to me that the entire notion that women have so much more to complain about is, itself, at least partially a result of *women calling out all the shitty things they're allowed to call out* - we don't hear about the stuff that men have to put up with, because men haven't been allowed to actually complain about it with any real momentum.

Which brings up the notable exception: ""But MRA's complain about this stuff, loudly, all the time, and they don't seem ashamed of it."" True. And this might be a particularly contentious point, I'm not sure, but I have to wonder if the current (awful) MRM became what it did precisely because of this ""prohibition"" on men complaining about their problems - toxic masculinity doesn't allow them to express hurt or injury in a genuine, honest way, but it *does* allow them *to be really angry at women*. Misogyny is just fine in toxic masculinity, as is anger. If they say ""I'm really frustrated that I'm expected to go out and get the highest-paying job I can, when really I just want to be a starving artist"", men and women alike (again, who are generally non-feminist) shame them, saying ""Be a man and go provide"". But if they say ""Women are all just gold-digging bitches, and it's *their* fault I have to take this boring career path if I ever want to get laid"", the dudebros stand up and cheer for them. And because it's a blatantly misogyinistic, hateful group making the complaints, those complaints are *very easily dismissed as unimportant.*

I'm not making excuses for Redpill types here. They seem pretty happy to play along with the script of toxic masculinity while wilfully ignoring the damage it's doing to them, because they don't have the courage to break with the script (as the early feminists did in breaking with theirs). Yes, society punishes men pretty harshly for breaking that script, but it's no excuse for turning one's frustration on women (and feminism).

But if we were to go to an extreme, here (this might sound bananas, and might in fact be): could the very existence, and societal acceptance, of feminism be symptomatic of the *privilege of expressing offense*? Is this why women have a healthy and strong movement behind them that's actually improving women's lives, and all men have is Redpill bullshit? (Yeah, there's /r/MensLib, which is great, but we don't hear about them in the news - it's a subreddit, not a movement.)

So after all this, my actual question: Do you think expressing offense qualifies as a ""female privilege""? And do you think it's as significant as I'm making it out to be here? Or am I coming at this from totally the wrong angle?",AskFeminists,1530588236,Stavrogin78,23,11,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8voxth/the_privilege_of_expressing_offense/,2018-07-02

139,The idea that ''feminists are not required to educate non-feminists but they are responsible themselves'' is wrong.,"https://www.feministcurrent.com/2013/10/10/feminists-are-not-responsible-for-educating-men/
A feminist gave me this link, to help diminish my ignorance of the feminism doctrine. But it didn't.

Other than teaching me that it's okay for feminists to generalize women, ''don’t tell women to be nice. We’re angry. We have every reason to be,'' as the article does, and that it's okay for feminists to make fun of how some men are inept at comprehending feminism, as that comic image does; it also taught me that it's my own duty to educate myself but therein lies the problem of that idea.

As the best voted reply on that article mentions: ''If you're engaging in a discussion about a topic and you happen to be an expert on that topic and the other person is not, how can you discuss it without first explaining the more technical details of it to them?''

If the article isn't black and white in the matter of education, its gray which is the idea that non-feminists, themselves, have the responsibility to self-educate so that a feminist can discuss the topic of feminism without risking educating them so it can strictly be a matter of different perspectives and opinions clashing.

As the article mentions, none shall ask a feminist to provide one of ''the hundreds of resources on the subject which he could, like the rest of us, go off and read'' but who wrote those? If a feminist didn't; non-feminists must comprehend the issue of feminism sufficiently which really makes all the questions that are asked at this sub-Reddit strange as those non-feminists appears not able to comprehend feminism. It really only suggest that feminism is widely understood and that those who still resort to mysogony--but not limited to--do so for they dismiss feminism and women's rights, as another reply on the article states.

But that isn't the actuality of reality. It's a flawed joke.
If the sentiment of the article is to reinforce the fact that feminists must not educate people of feminism, that it is a choice to do so; the correct title is: Feminists are not required to educate but can't expect non-feminists to soley self-educate.
It's basically the idea of asking a feminist to educate a non-feminist reversed; shifting the problem over to the other side isn't a solution. Some feminsts do not want to be required to educate; some men do not want to be required to self-educate, and in an anthesisis versus thesis argument the winner often is synthesis.

The article is really disuading non-feminists, who're really just ignorant in the matter of feminism and beyond but willing to learn, to avoid proposing questions to experts and rely on self-education--and if those experts also rely on the parctice of this article, avoiding asking feminists to educate them when they were ignorant, they are self-proclaimed experts. Or is it that feminists have no issues with educating fellow feminists to further their knowledge but do when it's a non-feminist, will a feminist abiding by the practice of the article avoid educating their neutral children or will they be an hypocritical exception?

Regardless of the answer to that question, some feminists do not agree with the article and bide their time educating people regarding feminism. It's not a futile effort. Of course most people know the agenda of feminism is important but every major change in human history only ever occured by pressure. Luckily, feminists are not alone in eduacting non-feminists of the subject. Non-feminists do self-educate. But if some feminists, such as the article writer, hopes to change human socaility more in favor of feminism by soley suggesting self-educating for the ignorant; will there ever be a major change?

In simpler, summarized words: Feminists are equally required to educate non-feminists as they are self-educating themselves.
By relying on the black or white or that twarted gray of the article; you create an unecessary hinder. I'm not going to suggest what the synthesis solution truly is but I do know if were a feminist that I would ignore the article in favor for a better shade of gray.",AskFeminists,1530619342,gamerh5,13,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8vrmpv/the_idea_that_feminists_are_not_required_to/,2018-07-03

142,I'm a hetero man happily married to a hetero woman. Recently had a conversation with an acquaintance who implied that our relationship is inherently coercive by nature of our heterosexuality. Is this true?,"To be clear, my wife and I love each other very much, and we are heteronormative individuals.  That being said, we're both quite left leaning and non-religious -- our marriage was ultimately ritualistic in regards to our declaration of love for each other.  We put off getting married for a long time because we did not, and still don't, consider it the most important thing, but it was something we both decided we wanted.

Now, as for the conversation I had with an acquaintance, she claimed that our relationship is, by its nature, coercive and violent and, in particular, I (as the male) am committing a violence towards my wife and subverting her agency and freedom by promoting the patriarchy and gender, which she claims should altogether be abolished.

Ok, so rather than say that's wrong or that I disagree, I actually have a very open mind and am ready to accept something if it is true, even if I don't like it.

However, now I'm beginning to feel guilty.  Am I really committing violence against my wife by the sheer nature of our situation?  As far as I can tell, she seems very happy and would be unhappy without me.  We don't judge or think poorly of those who are not heteronormative at all, either!

This is causing me to go down the rabbit hole a bit.  Is what we're doing ok? Is our sexual and romantic relationship...morally acceptable? I hate the thought of doing something morally reprehensible simply because I was raised to think or act a certain way without question.

I want to have a discussion with my wife about this kind of stuff but she might find it alarming.  I don't want to divorce or leave my wife, for fuck's sakes, but I also don't want to do something wrong and limit another human being's agency and individual potential.

143,Should men have any role in legislating on abortion and what would happen if they don't?,"TLDR: Should men, as voters and legislators, be involved in decisions about the legality (and potential restrictions) of abortions? Why do many polls indicate that there is no real split between men and women when it comes to abortion? According to some polls, men are even more pro-choice than women. If a feminist man feels he shouldn't have a say in the matter, should he still vote on it anyway?

Aside from my personal view on the subject, I always saw abortion as one of very few issues that really only effects women (please don't start a father's rights and/or what about male fetuses argument). As such, I believe it would make sense if women would simply decide among themselves what limits, if any, they want to impose on abortions without any involvement of male voters, politicians, or judges at all. Do you agree that this would be appropriate?

I then tried to look at polls to see what the result of this would be and I was surprised.

* A 2014 [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/170249/split-abortion-pro-choice-pro-life.aspx) indicates, as expected, that women in the US are more likely to be pro-choice than men.
* However, slightly older [polls](https://spectator.org/30346_do-men-and-women-view-abortion-differently/) actually show no clear divide between men and women on the issue. 
* In a 2015 piece about [polling difficulties](https://www.vox.com/a/abortion-decision-statistics-opinions/abortion-polling-mistakes), Vox again indicates that there is no real divide between men and women.
* For the UK, a [2014 piece in the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2014/apr/30/why-are-women-more-opposed-to-abortion) states that women seem to want **more** restrictions on abortion than men!

What is going on here? It's a difficult subject to poll correctly, so are many of the polls just wrong? Are women really no more likely to be pro-choice than men? Is this a topic were men are actually on board (just as much as women anyway) with the feminist viewpoint? Does this mean it is incorrect to frame the issue of abortion as one where male politicians try to control women's bodies?

Finally, considering all this, would it be wrong for (feminist) men to abstain from a vote on abortion? This also came up in the run-up of the recent Irish referendum on abortion.

If it was a son though, there would be less I could tell him that was supportive. I think ultimately it would come down to only a few less than helpful things to keep in mind. I'd tell him:

1. To never trust a woman when it comes to contraceptives, always assume she is lying or misleading you in some way because you just can't be sure.
2. That every time he has having sex with a woman he's risking up to 18 years of his future.
3. That ultimately the world will support her and her version of events unless you have incontrovertible proof, so make recordings.
4. Get a paternity test, don't sign anything, even if she lied you have little chance of escaping your fate once your name is on a piece of paper.

181,Do you think that feminism and transgenderism oppose one another?,"From my understanding, feminism is all about how females should be able to do whatever they want. 
You want an abortion? Go for it! 
You want to wear trousers? Yep, that ok!
Do you want to study engineering and play with guns? Absolutely fine.

Therefore, when trans people say that they feel like a woman, I get a bit confused. Feminism is trying to push that there isn’t such thing as ‘feeling like a girl’, as women can do exactly the same as men. However transgenderism is trying to push that there is a difference. 

To back up my point, there is a growing trend (at least that I have experienced - happy to be proved wrong) that when someone transitions from a man to a women, they start wearing high heels, going shopping, and doing other stereotypically female things. Similarly, when females transition to males, they start doing ‘masculine’ activities.

In essence, my questions are: 

-Do you believe that transgender people are strengthening gender roles, and hence hindering feminism?

-Does the concept of ‘feeling like a woman’ or ‘feeling like a man’ contradict what feminism is striving to achieve?

c. believe that these laws are part of a entire system which as a whole does not favour any gender over another

11,Is the label of intersectional feminist limited to black women?,"In a junior-level social work undergraduate course a classmate has recently been very vocal and adamant that the use of the label intersectional feminist is exclusive to black women as per Kimberlé Crenshaw, the theory's creator. My classmate sees social work as having culturally appropriated and misused intersectionality. 

I am not an expert but certainly not wholly unfamiliar with Kimberlé Crenshaw, and had never gotten the impression that her intention for the theory was exclusive. A large portion of the intersectionality perspective within social work comes from the work of Patricia Hill Collins, and I don't believe that she ever intended a race and gender-bound application either.  

The classmate openly invited discussion on the topic with them in and out of class, and I asked for some sort of evidence for the assertion. I was sent these links.

14,"A woman was chase out of the ladies washroom for looking too ""manly"". Is there a good solution to prevent this?","Some years back, an unfortunate woman was in the news as she claimed she could no longer use the ladies washroom, and had to resort to using gents instead.

To put things in context - She takes part in sports requiring great upper-body strength like dragon boat. She even took male hormones, was a regular gym-goer, had her hair cut short, and refrained from dresses, skirts etc. On the surface, she does look like a muscular man, but she identified as a woman.

It is absolutely her choice to look the way she does. The unfortunate side effect however, is that strangers often mistake her as a man. More than once, women have reacted with shock at seeing her in the washroom, and threatened to call security etc.

I live in Singapore, and the culture here frowns upon shared gender washrooms. I've been wondering about this topic recently, but I cannot think of any good solution. If I flipped the situation, I would not find it unreasonable for men to deny me the washroom if I choose to dress up as a female.

Thanks to feminism and other initiatives and movements women earned the right to vote in most countries during the 20th century, I believe it is one of the milestones of the movement, and once women earned the right to vote there were no longer protests about that since there was no need for it.

The goal was clear, and there were no gray areas, either women could vote or they couldn't.

A few decades forward, the movement got even more popular and it has many new goals, such as ending rape culture, ending female discrimination in recruitment, calling out male privilege etc...

These goals however are not easy to quantify, we can never really tell if they were reached or not.

20,Why are so many Western Feminists reluctant to criticize Islam?,"**Disclaimer: I am a brown male myself (Atheist though)** 

In my opinion, it is clear that equality between sexes is incompatible with the major monotheistic religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism). If you actually read any of these texts, they're full of hatred.

Now it SEEMS to me that a lot of White Western Feminists are perhaps...reluctant to criticize Islam? Not just Feminists though, but people who are left-wing. The only people who are really criticizing Islam are other Atheist scholars such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens (RIP), etc.

In terms of Feminism, it's without a doubt that Muslim majority countries definitely have a misogyny problem. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, etc all have very hardcore misogynist laws that are rooted in their culture. This might bring up the argument of ''it's culture not religion'' but it is difficult to divorce culture and religion. Much of those laws are derived from passages in the Q'ran.

One argument I find interesting is that people who are afraid to criticize Islam say that people shouldn't do it because Muslims are a minority in the West, and thus criticizing Islam is not the same as criticizing Christians because Christians have more power. I reject this argument because the West is the **only** place you can really get away with criticizing Islam without that much repercussion. If you criticize Islam in a Muslim majority country, it'd violate blasphemy law and you are likely to either be jailed or even put to death. There are countless examples of apostates and criticizers of Islam who are jailed and put to death in Muslim majority countries for the crime of 'blasphemy'. This begs to question, if you can't criticize Islam in the West because Muslims are 'powerless', then *where else* can you do it? Because there's just no way you can get away with it in Muslim majority countries.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My theory for why White Western Feminists are afraid to criticize Islam is because they are afraid of being perceived as racist. As most Muslims are non-white, it's very easy to be PERCEIVED as a racist if you criticize Islam. This was evident when Ben Affleck, quite embarrassingly tried to accuse Sam Harris and Bill Maher of racism, he was incapable of comprehending their argument.

It's different when criticizing Christianity, because most of them are white, hence it is easier to get away with. ",AskFeminists,1528477344,askerman97,39,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8plllq/why_are_so_many_western_feminists_reluctant_to/,2018-06-08

23,I dont think Harvey Weinstein was that bad at all.,"I am asking your opinion about that. What are your thoughts. Let me explain here. Ill try to keep it simplified and short but try read through it before you kneejerk.   


How many females actually put out to Harvey? Seriously. One hundred? Harvey Weinstein was a gatekeeper to ungodly amounts of wealth and fame. He could provide you with opportunities that you could only freaking dream of. And I am supposed to feel sorry that some women were offered the opportunity of a lifetime to put out for a night? Why cant I get that opportunity? How many people, men and women, would love that opportunity? How many talented attractive females could fill a role at any given time in hollywood?  


Most of human history life expectancy was 30ish and females did not have access to birth control or even proper menstrual items such as tampons. Combine that with men not wanting to raise other mens children, and you can see how monogamy is a historical and biological construct.   


1960s females get access to birth control and that flips the entire world on its head. You have the sexual liberation movement. I had to say all that to get to this point.  


Females now can put out with strangers over attractiveness. Hes hot, he hits the gym, I want to lay. Well harv didnt hit the gym, he just offered a once in a lifetime career opportunity which is far more valuable.  


Now that only sucks if you have virtue and say no I am not willing to engage in sex with a gatekeeper for ungodly amounts of fame and fortune as a career opportunity. Thats a choice, and that choice has consequences. Some of the consequences being that the next girl is willing to do whatever it takes to get her millions. To get hers. Then you get left in the dust.  


So you can bash on the men for being horny, but you have to bash on the women too for not having having virtues, being willing to sleep with the ugly guy for a career opportunity. Its a two sided coin. The women who put out to harv are just as guilty as harv. Harv was the tempter, but they ""sold their soul"" for a night to get massive amount of fame and fortune and sorry but not sorry.  


I dont think harv is as bad as its made out to be. I think there is a whole lot of variables not being considered such as the birth control factors and sexual liberation movement. Is it okay for a girl to sleep with a guy over nothing but he hits the gym, but its not okay for a guy to offer a girl a once in a lifetime career opportunity for massive fame and fortune. How is that not a double standard? I think the guy who is offering the career stuff is far more valuable to you, even though he is being a creep about it.

28,"What do you think of ""properly understood"" Jordan Peterson's ideas about pay gaps?","Hi.

I'm curious about this. One of my long-standing ideas has been in these kinds of polarized discussion - though I won't say I've been absolutely great at it either - is that before one attacks something, one should at least have a good understanding of what one is critiquing before they critique it. And I see many on, say, the conservative right who don't get things like feminism, they basically misunderstand important points like thinking ""toxic masculinity"" means ""masculinity itself is toxic"", and so forth.

But I saw this piece because I've also been deciding to look more into the right as well to at least give it a little more fair shake _too_ in the interest of _truly_ pursuing this goal nonhypocritically and wonder what you think. I'm sure you need no introduction to who Jordan Peterson is so I won't bother, but I saw this on The Atlantic, ""Why Can't People Hear What Jordan Peterson Is Saying?"":

https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/putting-monsterpaint-onjordan-peterson/550859/

And it cites some interviews with him where he's talking about the wage gaps and how that his position may not be being fairly represented on the progressive left, either - just as what I was saying about those on the right engaging in similar misrepresentation. And as I've challenged the right, I'd be curious to ask here what the feminist left would have to say about this so I was asking it here.

The interviews quoted have Jordan Peterson saying the following:

1. There is a wage gap,
2. _It does matter_, and it should _not_ just be accepted passively,
3. BUT, gender discrimination has only a SMALL - _yet not zero!_ (keep that in mind - both/and) - role to play,
4. Another _part of_ (not all!) it is that women have a natural, biologically based (based on what he's said elsewhere) personality tendency to higher Agreeableness (personality trait) versus men having a tendency to lower Agreeableness (higher Egocentricity),
5. _Yet women can compensate for this by displaying consciously more of that ""masculine"" egocentric/disagreeable style._,
6. There are like 17 other factors involved on that beyond these two and the personality one _is also small, only accounting for 5% of the gap_,
7. Repeats the classic conservative canard that ""equality of outcome"" is not _desirable_,
8. He repeatedly insists that he does not support a patriarchal system.

Now I want to say I am not saying I necessarily agree with his analysis. My point isn't to promote it as true or false. My point rather is to ask what you think - in the same interest as what I've done with regard to the right about their misinterpretation of the left, the same for the left as regarding the right so that at least a proper framing of the debates can be had to suitably mediate them - of Jordan Peterson's ideas when (at least I hope I have) more properly framed, at least if these interview quotes are to be suggestive. That is, what would you think of these ideas? Just to see discussion of the idea of the opposing side _in a proper presentation thereof_. In particular I'm especially curious about the fifth point - which almost sounds like a more feminist-style argument: that women can or should (regardless of your beliefs about the ""biological essentialism"" ""nature over nurture"" part or not) in at least some cases indulge more stereotypically-masculine behaviors, and its celebration of the more stereotypically-masculine woman, like in cases with larger, more muscular women figures, women action heroes, etc. Namely because is it possible perhaps that there isn't quite as big a gap between the two sides here after all and some bridging/mediation may be possible?

The other question I have is that so much of this discussion tends to end up at that old saw on point 7 - the whole ""equality of outcome"" business. What I wonder about is, to turn the light and questions of fair representation now back against Jordan Peterson, because I've _never_ seen this phrase actually spoken by a real feminist theorist but only by feminism's critics on the right, is _is_ this really a fair and adequate assessment of the goals of feminists or yet another straw man? Is there any feminist theorist who has explicitly advocated for that? As to me it seems what's really advocated for is equality of _freedom_, maximal freedom for individuals of the different genders to be who they are. (And isn't that kind of not so different from Jordan Peterson either with his sovereign individual? Though then to hit back at him - he shouldn't then be telling people they have no right to assert an identity against others' determination of it for them as he did in that one interview about gender pronouns that's on Youtube which I listened to, taking about ""closed linguistic categories"" and all (and did not seem to adequately understand what that concept means linguistically) - don't have the link to this one though) And that some sort of absolute equality is not necessarily necessary. I suppose in this last characterization I'm thinking specifically of bell hooks' presentation and framing of feminism, summarized in her short piece ""Feminism is for Everybody"" (which I got to read in a Gender Studies course at my University, so I remember it from there.). And of course there is a lot of internal diversity within feminism so maybe _some_ might insist on an absolute equality, but it would then also be a misrepresentation of feminism to paint feminism as one or the other thing, i.e. as a monolith. As far as I can tell, feminisms are extremely diverse, and this tends to get lost in the right's conversations thereabout greatly.

From my perspective, unpaid labor isn't exactly unpaid, if the standard of living of the family as a whole is enjoyed by the unpaid laborer. I believe that could be measured and studied -- something along the lines of {standard of living} minus {wages} compared between sexes. Has it been studied?

Everyone else was also asleep when we got back. We get dressed, and go lay in my bed, fall asleep. When I’m half awake in the morning, I hear one of them say, “oh her, she came back with him. Do better.” LMAO what? I was as respectful as I could be, didn’t have sex in the room, which many people do. But because you wake up and someone is in my bed you’re mad? Wouldn’t the feminist thing to do, for lack of better phrasing, encourage me to take the dick?

36,Does a poor man has more in common with a poor woman than he does with a rich man?,"I firmly believe in the Kyriarchy as an explanation as to benevolent sexism and why men still suffer with issues like higher rates of suicide and homicide compared to women despite the fact that they are a privileged group when compared to women.

It is the mix of male privilege and lower class hierarchy that puts poor men in the position where they are exploited as workers and driven to higher mortality rates. ""Being a man"" is firmly a socio-economic rule that demands that men are the breadwinners which is forced men to compete against each other and use women like prizes to be won.

I might even go so far as to say the socio-economic status is kind of the ""one ring that rules them all"" in terms of discrimination because it takes advantage of racism, sexism, homophobia to re-enforce the class hierarchy. That the 1% stays on top and the 99% are effectively subject to an economic feudalism.

It might explain why a lot of men feel indignant when generalized as having privilege when they might personally struggle with socio-economic equality. It's hard to feel like you have privilege when you're poor and you don't have have any socio-economic privilege.

""So, in this moment, here in the land of legislatively legitimated toxic masculinity, is it really so illogical to hate men? For all the power of #MeToo and #TimesUp and the women’s marches, only a relatively few men have been called to task, and I’ve yet to see a mass wave of prosecutions or even serious recognition of wrongdoing. On the contrary, cries of “witch hunt” and the plotted resurrection of celebrity offenders came quick on the heels of the outcry over endemic sexual harassment and violence. But we’re not supposed to hate them because . . . #NotAllMen. I love Michelle Obama as much as the next woman, but when they have gone low for all of human history, maybe it’s time for us to go all Thelma and Louise and Foxy Brown on their collective butts.

But, truly, if he were with us, wouldn’t this all have ended a long time ago? If he really were with us, wouldn’t he reckon that one good way to change structural violence and inequity would be to refuse the power that comes with it?

So men, if you really are #WithUs and would like us to not hate you for all the millennia of woe you have produced and benefited from, start with this: Lean out so we can actually just stand up without being beaten down. Pledge to vote for feminist women only. Don’t run for office. Don’t be in charge of anything. Step away from the power. We got this.

51,Feminism and prohibitionism,"(Notice: I AM TOTALLY ANTI\-PROHIBITIONISM! )

I've noticed that in some feminist circles, they seem to love Sweden as a perfect paradise. While is true that they hit the nail in several issues such as shared maternity leave, there are two issues that for me make Sweden an abhorrent place. Which are basically two prohibitionists flags.

The first prohibitionist flag is drugs. Sweden drug policy heavily relies on harsh enforcement and zero tolerance approach. And it has been praised in a lot of prohibitionist circles. HOWEVER !! it is important to notice that overdose deaths are way higher in Sweden than other more liberal countries such as CZ, NL or PT.

And the other thing is the so\-called swedish model for prostitution, which penalizes the buyers of sex. 

From my point of view, the only thing that the swedish model accomplishes is driving the trade underground and making prostitution way more dangerous. Also, the popping effect for prohibition just drives markets somewhere near (Denmark) until there is a better way to restore that market (internet escorting).

So, my question here is:

How do you feel about prohibitionism? Do you embrace the swedish model? 

If so ... What happens with freedom?

58,Patriarchy? Is there a clear definition in feminist context?,"I've been trying to formulate a title for a quite now, but my question boils down to this: I'm in a environment where its 'trendy' to hate feminism. I don't want to jump on a bandwagon and hate things I do not understand. So I've been trying to look into feminism in a systematic way, reading about the 1. functions 2. structure 3. history of feminism, and i have to say that the history really makes an interesting read, really rich and inspirational, but when i got to the functions and the structure of third wave feminism, things get really messy, really fast. First and second wave feminists fought among themselves a lot, but its safe to say they were united over working towards legislative changes, while third wave is all over the place. What I've manage to see as common is the fight against the patriarchy, which would have been ok, if the patriarchy had some proper definition, even here the believing in the patriarchy is listed as a requisite for being feminist, while figuring what the patriarchy exactly is, is left to each individual person to determine,  which for me is the problem.  Anything can be blamed on the patriarchy and everyone can  be targeted as an agent of the patriarchy. Given how some feminists dont challenge ideas that are opposed to theirs, as long as they come from other feminists (again, even here there are many comments saying there are many different types of feminists, with different ideas, and one group is not responsible for the ideas/actions of others), and how a lot of rad feminists shut down criticism from outside the movement, and considering how some of the most atrocious crimes in modern history are done in the name of the people, I'm honestly hesitant to call myself a feminist.

70,Looking for statistics for the wage gap. Please Read inside.,"Hey everyone, let me begin by saying I am very much in favor of equality. Recently I came to realize, I haven't managed to dig up as detailed statistics as I would like. As a result, I am not 100% sure of the wage gap or it's impact.

That's why I want your help digging up some statistics. First though, a definition.

Wage gap: The inequality between men wages and female's wages where all other things are equal.

With that definition in mind, I am looking for statistics that take the following into account:

* location
* education
* job title
* field
* company
* experience
* time employed at company
* productivity and performance

Basically I'd love to have a statistical study or source that takes every factor that could possibly influence wages into account and makes sure all is equal besides the variable of gender.

Basically like a scientific experiment, all independent variables must be eliminated except the one being studied. I've found ones showing wages of different education levels, found ones studying pay between men and women in different fields like truck drivers and doctors. 

However as we all know, a driver that hauls hazardous materials will get paid more than one that hauls stuff for Wal-Mart.

Please respond and show me some statistics that goes into much more depth. I want to help, but unfortunately so many studies take a stance from the outset, so it's harder to draw my own conclusion from them.

78,"Would it be accurate to label some branches of Radical Feminism ""Gender Essentialist""?","So there's a certain shade of people I've found on leftist forums and subreddits I'm subscribed to. People who often call themselves ""radical feminists"" or ""gender critical"". Andrea Dworkin types who will claim that males are essentially oppressors and violators of women, people are essentially the gender they were assigned as, and that certain sorts of male-female interactions (pornography/ marriage/ sexual penetration) are essentially acts of violence against women.

Their self-branding as ""radical feminist"" helps them blend in with other schools of thought and implies that people who disagree with them are ""liberals"" afraid of change. When they're trans-exclusive, they prefer the euphemism ""gender critical"", insisting TERF if a slur. (I personally take this as seriously as when neo-nazis take offense that you called them nazis instead of alt-right or white identitarian.)

I think it's useful to find a name to clearly differentiate these people from other schools of feminism. I'm against sexism and agree with many deconstructions and takes on gender relations, but I don't call myself the F-word mainly because of these people and the general lack of criticism they get from other feminists and the social justice community.

Gender Essentialism comes off to me as an accurate and distinct description of what they believe, and contrasts it with the existentialist feminism of [Simone de Bauevoir.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir) (“One is not born but becomes a woman.”)

When my five year old nephew comes to me frightened because some drunken women at a festival made graphic advances towards him, I assume the majority of you consider it just as much harassment as if the genders were flipped, and I assume the majority of you wouldn't consider him inherently an oppressor of women. However, there are some communities of people I know that might beg to differ, and feminists would do well to label them as their own group.

83,How to cope with sub-conscious discrimination?," I have had a spiritual rebirthing into the feminism movement in recent years: Long story short I come from a conservative family and had been completely ignorant all my life until I was 17 and had my perspective on life changed to where I am no longer the person I was when I was 17. My views on everything from gender, sex, identity, race, religion (I was confirmed as a Christian at 15), mental health- everything went from far right to far left. I think it had to do with I’m a really nice person and deep down hate discrimination because I was bullied as a kid. Fast forward to last night and I realized I still had internalized racism in me, like without thought. I was watching a documentary about mushroom trade in Mexico and something in my brain clicked that the people on screen are just that; people. They are just people who I am separated with by a language barrier but they would be no different from anyone who comes into work and orders a sandwich from me. I really feel a lot is changing in me for the better and it makes me sort of happy/sad that I am just now realizing this but I’m glad that I can tackle these thoughts now instead of just letting them fester without knowing or understanding.

They don't seem to be sex positive with many being against things like BDSM and use of porn, especially if this is in a straight couple. Many of their comments against men seem to go beyond constructive comments on male privelege to just hate. One comment I saw was ""men do not have souls or a moral compass"". Many of them don't like the sex industry with some of them going as far as saying that sex workers can't find it empowering because it inherently isn't. There was one post advocating for the abortion of all male foetuses to ""level the playing field"". Some posts seemed to show a belief that gender itself was the only way someone could be oppressed or atleast things like class or race are secondary.

Since she actually regretted it due to the fact that he hid from her the fact that he didn't have running water, would you say this is like rape by deceit?

107,"Is some level of ""gendered-ness"" okay or healthy?","So there have been many discussions here on masculinity and femininity, and the notion of mostly scrapping those ideas altogether. I'm largely on board with this when it comes to interests and traits: things like compassion, emotion, courage, interest in children or engineering should not be gendered. None of them are inherently masculine or feminine.

What I'm wondering is if there's a certain level of ""genderedness"" that could be healthy at all. Not in the traits or interests themselves, but perhaps in the expression of them, and providing that they were descriptive, not prescriptive.

Taking compassion as an example: men and women can both be compassionate, and let's pretend for a moment that we managed to de-gender the trait itself. There may remain a difference between how *most* men express it and how *most* women express it. Hugs are kind of a good example. When men hug, they tend to do the slap-on-the-back thing as they're doing it. I don't see this in women nearly as much. One's not better than the other, but it seems there's a gendered difference there, that we could (possibly) call a ""masculine hug"" and a ""feminine hug"".

There are all kinds of little differences of expression we could explore here, and collectively, they add up.

In these little differences of *expression* of a trait or interest, it seems to me that it wouldn't be crazy to label ""the way most women do it"" as ""feminine"" and ""the way most men do it"" as ""masculine"". At this point, it's still descriptive, not prescriptive (am I using those terms correctly? Someone tell me if I'm not). I think that even if we manage to de-gender the traits themselves, those differences of expression will remain in terms of majorities. Do you think there's harm in using ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" as descriptors?

Of course, tied into this is the need to do away with people policing each other's expressions of gender. 

A part of my thinking here is that gender seems to be a pretty major element of one's identity, and expressing one's gender seems to be a natural part of self-expression. If absolutely everything was de-gendered, if there were no societally understood signifiers of gender, would all avenues for that part of self-expression be lost? I mean, I'm not in a panic about this, just something I was thinking about.

108,Is Sexual Desire in some way sexual objectification ? Is all sexual objectification bad?,"This is both a question and a reflection, I want to make a difference between sexual objectification that degrades women and sexual objectification that comes from am honest and natural desire towards the human body and mind, basically, falling in love vs paying a prostitute (not bad per second, but the act of doing it reveals what wrong sexual objectification is and when it can become hurtful)

Since wanting to have sex with a girl (from an hetero man's perspective  in a patriarchal society like USA) means you are interested on being friends or couples  with this girl, then this desire would motivate people to act upon the idea that women can be used to fulfil your sexual needs. Then part of attraction (love,in any degree)  towards someone comes from an egoistic deliberate and instinctive sexual search , which is only one between more factors that lead people to search for parthners.I am not saying you are ready to hurt someone else just to go out with that someone , but you are not consciously thinking that by hitting on a girl you will make her happy (not most of the time, as a man that is what I feel and have seen in other men, and believe me , we do not feel we are doing wrong by doing that, but on the same tiMe you have to be careful to see if the girl clearly would make a mistake by going out with you). Going back to why we go out, you just want to see if the girl is right for you and then go out with her if she wills, it is not normal to see a man stop himself from hitting on a girl because he thinks ""hey I am not his type, maybe I should stop or she will regret having sex or even falling in love with someone like me, because she may discover in the future parts of myself she will not like as I already sense she will"". I would argue this is the strongest motivator when talking about couples and the reasons they are a couple.

Why?:
On predictably irrationality Dan Ariely psychologist from MIT says the best predictor of a marriage's success is the number of times they have sex per week. Obviously, as most people who knows statistics knows, this does not mean that better sex causes better marriage , it can be the other way around or something could be causing both phenomenons, but this shows that sex is a big part of a couple's success, so if being attracted sexually by someone means you are objectifying , then objectification would play a good part on marriages, but I don't know how good and bad.

I know objectification is not bad per se, I just wanted to talk with people like you who have thought about this issues because people has become so enraged by concepts like objectification that they are not willing to actually go deeper and think why they are wrong and how to overcome their bad aspects. Mostly men.

109,How does a man resist transgender urges under the current feminist climate?,"Lately it's becoming impossible to avoid feminism in the news - there are constant stories about how men need to take responsibility for sexual assault, how it's okay for women to hate men, how women don't need men any more and we're all useless. Recently the game Battlefield decided to make a World War 2 edition where women fight on the front lines of the war as soldiers, and they called everyone misogynists for disagreeing with that. These are just some of the examples of anti-male articles I've seen in the media. 

Basically I'm wondering how men resist the urge to transition to women? Ever since I started feeling guilty for being a male a few years ago, I've been seriously considering it. I feel such rage at being stuck in a male body and having these stereotypes thrust on me. Every time I'm interacting with a woman irl, in the back of my mind I'm thinking ""she thinks I'm toxically masculine.""

And nowadays with the public acceptance of transgenderism, it's becoming harder and harder to convince myself that gender does *not* matter. Feminism has taught me that being a man is bad, and transgender ideology has taught me that I'm actively *choosing* to be a man, even that I ""identify"" as a man.

I don't know how any man can resist these urges? How do they deal with the guilt of existing in a male body? ",AskFeminists,1529102212,blocksyourpath2,33,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8rf0go/how_does_a_man_resist_transgender_urges_under_the/,2018-06-15

112,"I'm sick and tired of women telling me that I'm ""entitled"" for being depressed over rejection and my lack of love life.","Love is one of the most powerful if not THE most powerful emotion known to mankind. Most people would do anything to be with a person that cares about them and would do anything for them. Not to mention kissing, cuddling  and other forms of intimacy can be so euphoric and can make you feel like all your problems have just floated away in that moment. Love is an emotion that everybody yearns for and that everyone deserves to feel regardless of gender or  orientation. It's just human nature. So why is it that a woman who perhaps has low self-esteem is completely allowed to feel upset and hurt over lack of love and is even met with sympathy over it but the minute a man does it he's seen as entitled and an incel loser who needs to get over it? What kind of equality is that? Until you've been  at the point where you hate yourself so much to the point where you just feel like the ugliest most unlovable piece of shit ever I don't wanna hear any of that ""entitled"" nonsense.  Just because you've been successful in your love life does not mean that you get to make fun of or put men down for wanting to feel this same emotion. And I don't even say this as a straight man. I say this as a gay man (where my dating pool is very limited compared to straight people btw) who is tired of being told by women that just because I yearn to have a close romantic relationship with another man and I'm frustrated that I can't have that that I'm some entitled loser.

127,How do you all feel about sexual selection?,"Quick definition : Sexual selection in mammals is when females decide not to mate (or rarely) with certain males. It's different from natural selection because those males can survive in their natural environment (they pass the natural selection test) , but are unsuccessful in finding a willing female to mate with.

With the rise of feminism and thus women allowed more choice in their sexual partners, it seems sexual selection has grown in impact. An example :  


[The Impact and Importance of Height on Mate Selection](http://humboldt-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/2148/624/ThesisFinal.pdf)

&gt; I argue that practices such as **arranged marriages and political disenfranchisement of women** , which were common in Europe until late 19th century, **suppressed the effect of sexual selection for height.** However, as European cultures became more socially progressive, sexual equality increased, allowing innate mate selection preferences to be expressed more fully. I use a cultural historical analysis and population genetics modeling to show that, in three European countries, **average height increased rapidly after cultural changes that led to greater freedom in female mate selection** , and that the rate and degree of height increase fits well what would be expected from a sexual selection process. ""

&gt; ""From a genetic perspective height is an important signal of good genes. Taller men have been found to live longer than their shorter counter parts. This powerful combination of social and genetic advantages for the children of taller men provides a strong basis for expecting positive sexual selection pressure for height in humans. Sexual selection for height has been **well documented in a host of cultures.** This female preference for taller mates can also be observed across a range of cultures the hypothesis that **it is an evolved psychological trait.** This preference has ramifications in the quality and quantity of mates a male might have as well. **Taller men are found to have ― prettier girlfriends, as defined by feminine characteristics such as desirable hip-to-waist ratios and skin quality. Taller men also have more long term and short term mates and have sex at earlier ages and later into life.** Women’s preference for tall mates also increases during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, when the probability of conception is greatest, which also argues for the adaptive origin of this preference. Finally, **infidelity studies have found that when a woman cheats she is more likely to do so with a mate who is taller than her current partner.** Consistent with the theory of sexual selection for height, taller men have been found to have more offspring than shorter men. There is also evidence that taller men are more likely to have long term mating partners and to have more partners than shorter men. This reproductive success provides evidence of a directional selection pressure for male height.

- I'd argue this very same effect is also at play with facial aesthetics, only facial aesthetics are a little harder to objectively measure unlike height, which is why there's much more data on height.

142,I've been caught in an unintentional sexist struggle at work. How do I help myself?,"I'm a guy. I manage the marketing team which consists of me, 4 female writers, 1 female analyst and 2 male tech guys. My manager is male.

It is my responsibility to see that all work that comes out of my team is proper, and for reasons that could be my strength and weakness, it's hard for me to accept sub-standard work or listen to excuses. A recent incident with 1 female writer has got me stuck in a bit of mire. Let me try to explain it.

Let female writer I had an issue with be X. One morning, while going through the past work of a freelancer X works with (all writers also work with a group of 2-3 freelancers), I found multiple cases of plagiarism. For those who understand SEO and online content know that plagiarism will fuck you and your ranking up. I decided to take this up with X to see if she could get in touch with her freelancer and get the entire submission revised. While doing this, I was also in the company of the 1 female analyst who is in my team. I requested X to get the plagiarised rewritten and also check previous submissions to see if there have been past instances which we might need to correct. 

Upon approaching her, X took on a confrontational demeanor, and in an obviously exasperated manner, made it clear that she will not do it as she is bogged down with a lot of other work and she has no time to check revisions. I noticed that she was getting irked by it so I discontinued my request and asked her to clam down. That in turn pissed her off further, and she left the room fuming. In that moment, I thought the pressure of work and its load may have gotten to her, like it gets to everyone including me, and she mustn't be in the best of moods today. I thought - Okay, fuck it, let's all just get back to work , I'll do the revision myself. In the next hour, I finished what had to be done. 

Then life went on. Until one day, it was brought to my notice that she had put up a Facebook status that day that said something along the lines of ""...that male colleague that talks down to you for not wanting to do what he can't be bothered to do"". Firstly, I was taken aback because:
- wasn't my work
- I am bothered. In fact, very. It's in my KPI.
- I did the work anyway
- Why male colleague and not colleague.

All this would still be fine and I'd allocate the behaviour to her being petulent and her status to be one where she's looking for societal validation. A little childish but nothing that we can't move on from. However, my CEO and other upper management folks have seen it and I've been called into a meeting tomorrow to judge my sexism and to see whether I'm fit to be in the company in the future.

I wanted work which I'm responsible for to be done but now I'm a sexist looking at unemployment because an ideologically possessed woman could not stand me asking her to do something she should have done. Not even considering that I'm her senior.

My partner is a girl who works in HR in a different company. 4 other girls in my team have never had a problem with me.

Maybe this touches me personally since I really like some (stereotypically) feminine aestethics and pieces of clothing. This trope pops up even in media I like, there's actually only one context where I saw it represented as a completely normal thing, which is in an episode of Steven Universe.

149,Is the end goal of feminism the end of men (and maybe women)?,"This isn't meant to be a gotcha or a ""checkmate, feminists!"", so anyone looking for that may I recommend  trying the next post. And this isn't an argument against feminism either.  


No this is something that has really been on my mind today. What I mean by the end of men is the end of men as a concept. Let us say hypothetically that feminism reaches its goal, that women are brought up to be completely equal to men. No privilege advantage, no power differential, completely equal. Would anyone still be a man?  Would there even be men/women or would we all kind of just...amalgamate? We understand that being a man has costs as well as benefits, right? Just like being a woman and being anything else has a cost. If men and women become completely equal, who would take on those costs? If you could have the benefits of being a woman in society and still have the benefits of being a man, why wouldn't everyone take the woman social role?  


And, dialing it back a little bit now, lets say we approach very close to complete equality. The same question still comes to mind. Lets say we have traditional gender roles still , traditional views on dating. Would anyone still be a man?",AskFeminists,1529351661,NemosHero,7,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8s2hlu/is_the_end_goal_of_feminism_the_end_of_men_and/,2018-06-18

152,WOC only space,"I'm a member of a group at my university focusing on decolonizing spaces for women of color so we can discuss our issues.  While we do allow white people and men to our discussions on occasion, recent meeting have made it clear that we need to create a space just for women of color so we can feel comfortable speaking freely.  The university stated that we must have a precise definition of who is not allowed to attend the meeting if we are to have it.  To that end we created the following list:  ""All cis sex and gender men, and men not identifying as part of the LGBTQ+ community are asked to not attend this particular meeting.  In addition, all persons identifying solely with ancestry from the following: Andorra, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greek Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland (unless Saami), France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway (unless Saami), Poland, Romania (unless Romani), Russia (unless indigenous or Siberian), San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Sweden (unless Saami), Switzerland, Ukraine (unless Tatar), United Kingdom, are asked not to attend. As stated above, those identifying as members of the indigenous peoples (such as Saami, Tatar, indigenous Siberian etc.) of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Ukraine or Russia as well as Romani are welcome to attend.  Persons identifying as mixed or white passing people of color are also welcome to attend.""  Do you think this list is effective and are their any omissions or errors? Is it too extensive or is it better to be thorough? We found that this was the best way to get the university to take our demand for a WOC space seriously, and has been approved by the school.

156,[Honest Debate] Do you think men should be obligated to pay child support in this situation?,"We are at a point in history where the choice to have a baby and carry it to term is 100% a woman’s choice (birth control, abortion, etc.) Let’s look at a hypothetical: the mother has 100% control and responsibility over whether she has that child or not. The father of the baby has 0% control over if the mother has the child. However, as soon as the mother makes the father’s choice for him and decides to have the child, he is now obligated to pay her huge sums of money for 18-21 years. 

So here’s my proposal: anytime there’s a father and pregnant mother, the choice to have the baby is still 100% hers. However, if the father does not want the child, he bears no child support obligation as long as he offers to pay 50% of the abortion cost.

Let's just say for arguments sake abortion is definitely murder. I don't say this to get around the debate about what is or isn't human. I say this because it leads nicely onto...

Most people who are anti abortion seem to be pro war. They believe in this idea of ""virtuous violence"" - justified murder to save others.

In many situations women are aborting because if they carried the baby, their lives are finished. Not in the sense that oh a child is a burden and an inconvenience, but some women simply would commit suicide if forced to carry an unwanted child. It's very serious.

So in my mind abortion in that case can be seen intellectually along the same lines are murdering innocent people during war. Virtuous violence.

0,"Do you think that in an effort to uplift women/feminism, there is a growing trend of biological determnism/essentialism?","I've learned a lot from this forum, I just wanna say that, you guys are cool.

Anyway, I've feel like there's a trend recently (not necessarily here, just generally speaking) where, in an effort to support and empower women, there's a growing element of gender essentialism/determinism.

Now, let's get one thing out of the way. I like that women are moving up/improving. I'm not one of those guys that confuses women empowerment with men falling behind, or gets butthurt over #yesallmen or #menaretrash. I have no problem calling out toxic masculinity,

But I don't like how it's being framed in a ""women are more naturally kinder, their brains are less aggressive, which is why they are better leaders"" or ""men are worse at child rearing because they lack the empathy and have too much testosterone which makes them probe to violence"" and all that.

For instance, this article (and others on the site) use gendered sterotypes about women being peaceful and nurturing and men being agressive and childish: https://feminismandreligion.com/2018/05/14/women-and-men-in-egalitarian-matriarchy-by-carol-p-christ/

You have the time magazine article about the end of men, and this other article https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/obama-women-superior-men-washing-up-driving-patriarchy&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEv5LgwJrbAhUnwlQKHc2aCdMQFjABegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sQYB9WNEIVoASXKwNGGXa , and a lot of other articles like it recently that use mixture of current statistics about school, biological arguments (testosterone, brain differences), and even diatribes about how women being perseverent makes them better than men as a means to prop them up.

They're very demeaning and assumptive, and I hate how casually it is accepted. Just because I'm a guy, it doesn't mean that I inherently will cause violence, it doesn't mean that I can't NURTURE. Just because I have testosterone it doesn't mean that I can't be peaceful. All this essentialism just reinforces gender stereotypes that end up *pigeonholing* people again - women again, too.

And that's why I hate it. I read stories about matriarchies and find it cool how they are peaceful. But I hate the generalizations that come from them; the praise of them ends up having to generalize men as being *inherently* unsuitable for leadership or peace; that the optimal situation is for women to lead, because men are *inherently* incapable of leading, that they don't need to be involved fathers because all they care about is sex, and don't care about/lack instincts in regards to taking care of kids. It's so blatantly backwards, it intentionally ignores socialization, and I don't know why. It can be pretty damaging to one's esteem when people immediately assume less of you. I don't want to live in a place where I can't do what I wanna do just because of preconceptions about me due to my gender. Women have dealt with that long enough, and we shouldn't impose that on anyone for revenge.

The thing that makes it worse is that I don't know how common this is. The feminism on this site is great and something everyone should get behind, but **I don't know if the views here are the majority or not among feminists.** I usually assume they are, and they probably are: It's just hard to get a consensus on feminist viewpoints - since anyone can call themselves a feminist - so it's hard to know which viewpoints are the majority.

3,Isn't it a bit hypocritical to generalize men(or white/straight men) but to be against generalizations of women(or minorities)?,"Whenever i see someone make generalizations about a certain group(like women for instance), they get told that not all women are like that.The answer to that most of the time is that ""everyone knows that not all of them are like that"".This then gets answered by the argument that not everyone will notice this and take it for the truth.Even when someone is clearly joking, people will bring this argument up.

However, when i see women or feminists make hashtags like #menaretrash or #yesallmen, no one bats an eye.Sometimes i even see people actually DEFENDING the claim ""which people are supposed to not actually believe because everyone knows not all men are like that"".The same argument could be made here yet no one says something against it.

This honestly really confuses me.I know that atleast the majority of the feminists don't actually think that such generalizations are true.However,some of them do and those who do go totally unnoticed.Also, you really don't need to wonder about claims of feminism being ""an anti-men hate group"" if you regularly make such claims and tolerate them in your movement.

The thing is, those generalizations would only be half as bad if there were some ""disclaimers"" clearing the whole thing up.But unless you sepcifically ask for it, you will not hear such a thing.And while you may shift the blame away from you with this, i think that i should not be forced to ask someone from a social movement just to know their main premise/goal.It's their job to explain their movement.And even if it wasn't, it would still be neccessary to actually change something.

And to not fall into this hypocrisy(atleast imo),

I do not believe that every feminist tolerates this.I also do not believe that every feminist who does tolerate this is against men.


However,some of them do.And this should not be tolerated.
Is there something i missed?Or are there reasons i don't know about?Or do you believe it is not your responsibility to educate those people because they should do it themselves?

7,Do people realize SWERF is used as an insult to shut down criticisms of sex industry?,"Where do you see self identifying SWERFs fully declaring that they hate sex workers and do not count them as women? One you don't because SWERF is an insult and not a real group of people. No feminists identify as a SWERF, they're used as an insult to deride women for having challenging opinions.  

Yet if you actually talk to any radical feminists who dare challenge the status quo of sex industry, porn industry they're immediately dismissed and insulted as SWERFs. The actual radical feminists ideas are often things like adopting Nordic model of approaching sex work that makes soliciting for sex illegal NOT being a sex worker in an effort to reduce the number of trafficked victims and protect the sex workers from legal punishments. 

First of all if you understand the basic definition of radical in radical feminism or radical anything, it's about challenging the fundamental nature of the entire system not about individual participants who are often forced to. They're anti sex-industry which they see as patriarchal and exploitative not anti individual sex workers.

- Dating the biggest assholes imaginable and then complaining about male assholishness.

- Being a pushover, to the point of toxicity.

12,What is the feminist view on environment vs biology?,"I support feminism in general but there is something that I do not really understand. And I suspect it will be controversial but I really want to know your view.

Whenever we notice there is a clear difference between males and females, there are two possible explanations. The reason is either sexism which can create differences in many ways. Or the reason is biological. Sometimes it can be both, but always it is at least one of these things.

In other words, either it is environment or biology. A scientist would assume either one is possible. Environment greatly affects humans and other animals. Likewise, biology greatly affects animals, including humans. And we know some of the differences between males and females exist because of the environment. And we also know some of the differences between males and females exist because of biology. Until you have enough evidence, you can't really tell why some differences exist.

I can understand why sexist people choose to believe difference in biology is the reason. Because they are sexist (therefore usually not very smart) and that answer is consistent with their sexist belief.

But on the other hand, I wonder something. I got the impression that feminists are eager to blame the environment when it is too early to say or sometimes even when evidence suggests biology is at least a part of the problem. 

Before making assumptions myself, I will ask you to correct me if I am wrong.

1. Did I get the wrong impression? Do you follow scientific approach and acknowledge what the science says or do you sometimes jump the gun?

2. If science ever endangered feminism movement (which is highly unlikely) or challenged the idea that both males and females are equal (highly unlikely), which would you prioritize - science or feminism?

3. Is your default assumption that a difference between males and females is caused by the environment? If yes, is it to prevent sexist people from claiming the difference is biological? Or to remain optimistic that in different environment differences can be decreased?

4. Since males have a male privilege, does that mean men are responsible for differences of outcome even when the difference is biological?

4. I might have missed or overlooked something important or focused only on certain aspects of this topic.

15,"Feminists of Reddit, What would real equality look like and what would it take to get there?","I'd like to have a discussion about what real equality would look like to you. My current position is, perfect equality can't feasibly exist and isn't actually desirable. 

For example think about the road death toll, obviously nobody wants to die driving down the road. But its not necessarily feasible to reduce that death toll to zero, but lets try anyway, so we'll make some rules.

1. Speed limit reduced to 5mph
2. Every driver takes a reflex/cognitive test to ensure they're adequately prepared to drive.
3. All cars are to be a mile away from pedestrians and other cars at all times.
4. All cars are perfectly mechanically maintained by a central group.

That would almost do it. The world couldn't function, and yet I'd guarantee someone, somewhere would die to a car. Its an admirable goal which ultimately would be awesome, but what price would we be prepared to pay for it? 

This is somewhat analogous to how I look at equality and the world at large. Nobody wants awful things like murder, racism, theft, betrayal, sexism, lies or poverty to exist. I can't imagine a world where those things are reduced to zero, but obviously they can and should be minimized as much as possible.

So to put a point on the question. What level of inequality is acceptable and between who is it acceptable for that level of inequality to exist?

It's going to be easy to see this as me saying, ""It's too hard to completely eradicate all the horrible shit, so don't bother trying. Just shut up and play along"". That is absolutely not what I'm saying. I just see a lot of people pulling an incredibly heavy load to some undefined destination, which is demoralizing and difficult.

22,Sexism in the workplace... need help!,"I hope this is the right thread for this situation... I apologize if it's not! 

So, my friend [25F] has been working as a financial analyst at a tech company for a little over 3.5 years. Her office is mainly filled with middle aged, conservative white men, and lately her experiences as a young female have gotten a little out of hand and she doesn't know how to deal with it. 

She is a hardworking, incredibly smart person (and puts in like, 10 extra hours per week to complete all the tasks that they want her to do). She is trying to get a promotion but she needs to remind him to promote her, even after he says that she deserves one. She often does not get credit for the work that she does, and her presentations are taken over by guys in other departments, so she loses out on the opportunity to present it to the board. People even come up to her and asks if she understands the material and belittle her abilities by saying they can come to them if they need help. While this might be perceived as a nice gesture, the people that do this only do it to her... no one else in the office, which seems problematic

She is afraid to advocate for herself out of fear of being perceived as a bitch and because when she does advocate, her coworkers react negatively by saying, 'wow what's your problem today?', 'you're on one', 'don't complain;, etc, etc. 

This week, she and a guy from another department were working on a project together. I guess they had been disagreeing on what to send in to the CFO, but were going to discuss the information on Friday .While she was out of the office for PTO on Wednesday, the guy went behind her back and sent in a completely different report to the CFO than what they had agreed on sending in. This was the last straw for her, and she wants to do something about the perceived/actual sexism that she's experiencing but doesn't know how, because of the culture that exists in the office and because of her coworkers' identities. 

**Is there anything that she can do to start changing the culture at her office?** What can she say that is polite, but challenges these people's behaviors? Are there any female financial analysts/females in tech that have experienced this that might be able to share their experiences or give advice on how to handle the situation?

33,"I'm both a woman of color and disabled. Is it wrong for me to ""prioritize"" disability activism over feminism and racial justice?","I'm a woman of color who is also disabled with Multiple Sclerosis. Ideally, I would devote equal amounts of time to anti-oppression politics of different axes (race, disability, gender), etc., but I'm extremely busy with working long hours to make ends meet, and the fact that I'm not super mobile with my chronic illness (which can range from being mild to debilitating). I've been on Social Security disability when it's particularly bad.

Personally, for me, I've felt 10,000 more marginalized from my disability than I have felt from being Latina or being a woman. I got MS three years ago, and lived 21 years as a latina. So, I'm personally much more animated by working on disability activism than on racial justice and feminism, since disability has a much more immediate and severe impact on my quality of life than race and gender at the moment. I still support racial justice activists and feminists, but it is not my priority at the moment compared to disability rights. 

However, I will not tell others that racial justice or feminism can't be priorities for them. Lots of Latinas and women face horrible oppression and systemic marginalization due to institutional racism and the patriarchy: taking an intersectional approach to dismantle kyriarchy is important. However, in part because my disability is invisible, I've had other feminists call me out and harshly criticize me for not making feminism my number one priority in anti-oppression politics, saying it is invalidating to women to say for me personally, disability has been more marginalizing than being a woman. I'm just speaking for myself, and making my own priorities based on my life experiences. I fully support others making feminism their top priority based on their life experiences, and support feminists whenever I can and there's overlap with disability rights.

But I'm still shamed, and it comes off as ""able-ist"" to me. Feminists have told me to prioritize ""disability feminism,"" but I don't just want to help disabled women. My boyfriend has lupus and is one of the best people I know, so I want to help men with disabilities too. I identify first as disabled, second as a woman, and third as a latina.

There are MULTIPLE REASONS for the gap, and the simple-minded observation that women earn less than men and that the reason (the single reason) for that is discrimination is not helpful and is almost purely driven by ideological presumption. It's possible that actual discrimination accounts for a reasonable proportion of the variance, but I'm not convinced...

45,How to ask for sex/express sexual interest etc. without it being harassment,"So I'm bisexual and I find it much easier to find casual hookups with other men than with women. On Grindr, I can say hi to someone and then immediately turn the conversation sexual in some way, and will sometimes meet up with them with the intention of sex and nothing else. On other apps like tinder however, I'm aware that this isn't considered appropriate to approach women in the same way. In fact it's very confusing for a number of reasons. 1. It's important to ask for consent yet, under Australian law it is actually a form of sexual harassment to ask for sex if the woman in turn says no. That makes me wonder, how are people supposed to have sex of they're not allowed to ask for it? Some have argued that you should have to be in a romantic relationship before hand, but then how do one night stands occur? I can't read someone's mind and magically know if they're going to say yes or no. 2. Feminists argue that women should be allowed to have as much meaningless sex as they like without being judged. Yet, many feminists will simultaneously shame men for disrespecting men if they only want casual sex, saying that they're pigs and only want one thing (as if that's a bad thing). Just tonight a male was shamed when a female I follow on instagram posted a screenshot of him asking for a root and politely accepting rejection when she said she wasn't interested. I can't understand what he did wrong. I'm becoming more and more paranoid that I will become socially ostracised or get in trouble with the law because a woman will decide she's offended if I ask for sex, make an invitation for sex, or express some sort of sexual interest.

48,What's your feeling on the idea of male disposability?,"I've had a few discussions about this here on this sub, and I'm trying to get a sense of the general feminist position on the idea of male disposability.

Let me get a couple of things out of the way, though: this is *not* a ""Why isn't feminism doing more about this?"" thread. Even if male disposability is a real thing, I think it would be outside of feminism's wheelhouse to deal with. Also, even if it's a real thing, I'm not necessarily holding it up as evidence of ""oppression"" against men, but perhaps a real issue that we face.

The evidence for the concept seems pretty compelling to me. Throughout history, humanity (generally speaking) has been content to send men into peril, much more so than women. I don't want to get bogged down into another argument about the draft, and I realize that the perception of women as inferior soldiers definitely is a factor in the combat thing, but I do think male disposability is a very real factor alongside that.

As a society, we also seem to have a less outraged reaction when men suffer a tragedy (going missing or being murdered) than when it happens to a woman. I can't back this one up with sources, but it seems right - if anyone's got sources to contradict this, fire 'em at me and I'll take a look.

Then there's the Boko Haram thing - the West went nuts when they kidnapped girls, but had remained conspicuously silent when only months before, they'd carried out another raid, let the girls go, and burned the boys alive. (I know, I know, this example is coming straight from the Karen Straughan interview in The Red Pill, but I did look it up and it seems to check out).

So back to the actual question: Do you feel that male disposability is a real thing, that someone, *not necessarily feminists*, would be right to call attention to and work to address?

52,Feminism in a time of relativism,"Hello everyone,

What is a feminist? Up until a certain point of time there was a certain consistency on what the word meant.

But now it seems that the movement has grown so big and diverse that the word holds no clear meaning, what is feminism for me is probably not the same for you.

And this brings about a question: Since the movement has no clear vision, no authority figures, no clear set of values, no clear mission, is calling ourselves feminists still relevant in portraying our identity?

Because at the end of the day we refer to ourselves as feminists so that others have an idea of who we are and what we believe in, and if the word is no longer accurate enough to do that, maybe we should start looking for something else.

56,Taking responsibility for my male privilege,"Hello everyone,

What I understood so far from being in this sub is that it is acceptable to be a man, what is not acceptable is to deny that being male is a privilege.

Fair enough.

I happen to live in a third world country where I represent a religious minority, and if I were to compare myself to the average religious female she is, all things considered, more priviliged than I am.

And yet I do not see people being asked to take responsibility for their religious privilege, educational privilege and other kinds that actually give more power than male privilege.

And so the solution is to scale privileges by order of power,  the first being wealth, the second religious majority the third gender privilege etc etc.

But the more I think about it, the more incoherent it gets, because more privilege factors need to be accounted for, such as physical &amp; mental health, access to opportunity, supportive family etc etc.

And it never ends, as the quote goes ""the more you know the less you know"".

After going through this thought process I no longer believe that I should take responsibility for my gender privilege because it is just one small building block of my identity and if I were to take responsibility for all the other positive ones and victimize myself for all the negative ones I would put myself in a very unproductive mindset.

74,Do Feminists Date Uncircumcised Guys?,"I just went through a bitter break up with my girlfriend.

Important note:- She has hairy armpits, the reason i said it because it is important later on.

-But that's all the backstory. Anyhow, whenever we try to engage physically, one thing i always realize she would consciously stare at my penis like its a foreign object, honestly it never bothered me because i understand its like when people sometime stare at a handicap person and not try to look at him/her the 2nd time so that they won't feel weird or awkward, but in my relationship it happened time and time again (maybe that is why i never got a blowjob). So one day i just had to ask it (remember i said she has hairy armpits?), i told her how would she feel that if i did the same thing like how she looks at my penis, then the things went south she started throwing tantrum like how men has it easy and its patriarchal society, one thing happened after another and we eventually broke up on a bitter note.

:A dear friend of mine gave me an advice that in our society its okay for women to not look like barbie, but if its men who doesn't look and act like He-man, public shuns them.

“Queer”

“Lame”

Marriage itself

Stay at home moms

“Girl” (infantalizing v not infantilizing)

“Bitch”

83,Is patriarchy or the way it is enforced undesirable?,"Hello everyone,

Before we get started, let's define patriarchy:

\&gt; **Patriarchy** is a** social syste**m in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of** political leadershi**p,** moral authorit**y,** social privileg**e and** control of propert**y. 

Western society, according to this definition, is then indeed a patriarchy.\(Although not very clearly in moral authority, social privilege and control of property\)

For patriarchy to turn into an egalitarian system, roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property need to be equally represented.

For patriarchy to turn into matriarchy, females need to be more represented than males in those roles.

Since gender is currently not an official requirement to hold one of those roles, it is possible for women to hold primary power and predominate in them, turning society into a matriarchy. 

And that is **not undesirable as long as it happens based on principles of integrity and individual choice.**

The current issue is that **patriarchy has been, and still is, enforced in ways that put the gender before the individual.**

Following this thought process, we can make this conclusion: **Patriarchy, matriarchy or egalitarianism are not inherently good or evil.** 

**Request:**

I frequently come across feminists who believe that patriarchy is not reasonable, and I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.

85,Do men with negative history who associate with feminism hold it back?,"As above.

Sometime back, I made a post here asking about why some women associate with GC despite not being transphobic themselves. Unfortunately, it caught GC's attention. GC then made public every negative and disgusting post I ever wrote (I admitted to some sickening fantasies years ago, things which I'll never admit to people IRL, and which I sure as hell won't act on).

GC's point is - men are a stain on feminism. I am part of the problem. By admitting men like me as feminists and allies, feminism is letting the wolves in.

I wanted to ignore them. But GC accused me of using the term ""TERF"" as a cheap way of shutting them out. So, I read through their subreddit, of what they thought of me, of their views on feminism, and it disturbed me greatly. I can't stop thinking about what they said.

88,Is there a (relatively) coherent definition of feminism and/or what it is not?,"**Content Warning** - _discussion of transphobia and trans-erasure_

I have read the [Robot Hugs comic](http://www.robot-hugs.com/definition/) about the inherent difficulty in 'defining' a word such as racism and the other various _'isms_ and the inadvisability of attempting to constrain a movement into an entry in a dictionary. I also neurotically (in a literal, non-ableist sense) attempt to avoid [Presentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)) in my studies of history, studies which I utilise in a crude attempt to avoid bias and exclusionary attitudes.

These, together with such articles as [this](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/wj4mn5/raquel-willis-terfs-dont-deserve-to-define-themselves-as-feminists) are causing me severe disquiet. In agreement with my understanding that feminism does not follow a model such as that of the Catholic Church, in which one can be excommunicated for sin (for lack of central authority if no other reason); when reading the title it is obvious that this particular author believes in a distributed (sorry, CS major here) definition of what Feminism is and what it is not. 

My disquiet stems from my lack of belief that **few** enough people who identify as feminists, now or at any point in history for which the word existed, are/have been what we now term as TERFs to be able to define feminism as not being aligned with such peoples' views. I am asking if we as intersectional (_? not sure if right word_) feminists possess the authority or the numbers to meaningfully hold the definition of feminism to be aligned with our beliefs. Nowadays people have no excuse, but can we condemn the feminists of the past or even deny their feminism without succumbing to presentism as previously discussed?

I wholeheartedly believe that intersectional feminists hold the moral authority and occupy the moral -high-ground (definitely the wrong term, sorry), but I worry that we are outnumbered and that the situation is getting worse. Sorry for the (literal) paranoia, my final question is:

96,Are feminist principles only for people that feminists like?,"First, I recognize that feminists aren't a monolith and that no individual in a group/political party/belief system bears any responsibility for the beliefs of another.  So when I use the term ""feminists"" in my question, please only take that to mean ""the seeming consensus of people who identify as feminists as represented in the articles/posts/comment sections that I've read.""  

With that out of the way, there's a weird pattern I've seen in feminist articles online, in which a certain practice will be decried as socially unacceptable under any circumstance, but then when that practice is used as a weapon against anti-feminists, the ""hot take"" is that somehow the person on the other end being an opponent serves as an exception to the rule.

As examples - 

* Body shaming has routinely been decried in feminist circles.  Yet  insults of Donald Trump that focus on his appearance/weight/implied penis size are consider in vogue and acceptable.  The justifications I've heard for this range from ""well, it's the only way to hurt him"" (which ignores the argument that body shaming is bad because it hurts everyone who has the trait being mocked) to ""he is evil and deserves it"" (which implies that the principle itself isn't absolute but only applies to a certain class of people)

* Just recently, Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a c*nt on air.  And I have probably read about a dozen articles about how that word is degrading and unacceptable as an insult to a woman.  I personally agree with that stance.  Yet this article is practically gleeful in the fact that it happened, and the comment section is basically a cheering section over the fact that it happened (https://jezebel.com/all-of-our-favorite-conservatives-are-pissed-about-sama-1826453169).

104,What is the basis for the feminist concept of equality?,"I am curious as to what the feminist argument for equality is. Often I hear ""women should be treated equal"", but no reason is ever given beyond those that appeal to emotion. Equality is self evident for Western societies since the very idea of freedom and liberty is ingrained inside of us all, for the most part. But to those unaware and reluctant, how would you argue feminism using pure reason and logic?

Also one of the things that I've observed among feminists is their victim mentality. It seems to me that feminism relies on the good nature and good will of others. Feminism has a voice in the West due to our affable nature and beliefs in equality. But our beliefs in equality \*comes\* from somewhere, it isn't arbitrary. So what will feminist do when push comes to shove? Would you take up arms?

Real American Patriots who cherish their rights will threaten violence to protect their rights and are willing to fight for their freedom. ""Give me liberty or give me death"" is part of the Liberal ethos. If Handmaid's Tale becomes reality, what would feminists do?

\*\*On a side note:\*\*

I try to be as charitable as I can. Although I am not a feminist, I will not dismiss their criticism as categorically ""false"" or ""wrong"". Especially when the criticism is widespread. If 1million women felt like society was sexist, I wouldn't say ""they're all wrong"".

105,What is the best way to be an ally to others/promote intersectional feminism?,"This is a difficult question to phrase. Let me give background: I am a white, female college student from a generally middle\-class upbringing. Aside from mild sexism due to majoring in STEM \(just your typical dudes constantly undermining software engineering students that happen to be female\), I have not faced very much adversity in my life. However, I really want to be a good advocate for all women, members of LGBTQ\+, POC, and generally any body of people that are under oppression. 

The problem I have is that there are no clear rules on how to be a good ally.

I see a lot of stuff go down online, where white feminists will make some big show of being ""woke"" and will try to police those that they deem ""oppressed"" in order to ""help"". Or white feminists will make some story about being oppressed in a way that makes them ""understand"" the particular brand of oppression that POC or LQBTQ\+ people endure\-\-like, some sort of ""hey! I'm oppressed too. Can I have some points for being so woke?? :\)"" . Every now and again someone goes off about ""the A in LGBTQ\+ is for Ally. I'm special too. :\)"" . I don't mean to sound accusatory against white people, or those who have other sorts of privilege. I don't know\-\-this might sound a little jumbled or dumb.

I think what I'm trying to say is, what can I do with the privilege I have to actually help the movement of intersectional feminism? I care about equal rights for everyone, even if I am not a person of color or part of LGBTQ\+. I think being online too much makes me feel a little sick, because watching all these flame wars in so\-called ""feminist"" groups while my country gets led around by a sexual predator has put me in a slump. 

I'm sorry if this has gotten jumbled or confusing, or if my question is just dumb. But...what can I do to help causes?

112,Delegating responsibility of change to others.,"Hello again! Back with another topic of discussion! I'll do my best to word this as respectfully as possible. If something comes off as disrespectful please feel free to let me know so that I can make another attempt at wording it to better get across my thought. Full disclosure: I'm a CIS White male who comes from an upper middle class back ground and works blue collar. 

I seem to see this come across on a lot of topics where a group feels down trodden and hopeless in a specific area of society. Excuse the mess, my mind is rather chaotic and my ability to write and organize thought is poor at best. I'll attempt to organize these thoughts in a somewhat coherent way.

Example one would be women not perusing STEM fields. From what I gather this is an issue of society not being accepting of women wanting to be there. I absolutely believe this to be true. While I'm not in STEM I've experienced this in both my trade and my trade schooling. When a woman enters we all wonder if we are going to have to tone down our banter? Can we make the same crude jokes? Is it going to make our work place less fun to have to cater to someone? I understand this though. People spending 50 hours \(at least\) a week at a job view it as a part of their social life. On the flip side I get not wanting to be uncomfortable or unaccepted for 50 hours of your week too! I'd just like to point out there are a lot of environments with established levels of interpersonal interactions. 

Now coming from a well off \(large property owning family, a couple family owned international business worth 7 digits and such\) when I entered schooling for a trade my grand parents felt the need to question my decision. I've been a tech nerd my whole life and was transitioning into blue collar. I believe the exact words were as follows ""There are a lot of 'rough' people in that type of work. You sure you'll be able to handle it?"" So even as a white male I wasn't expected to be able to handle an environment because my version of masculinity was far far different than what was in this environment and I was coming into it with very few manual labor and mechanical experience. So when entering the field I knew there was a certain level of tolerance and ""fitting in"" I would have to do to have a desirable experience. So do they say things I disagree with? Absolutely. Do they make jokes I find uncouth? Of course. Do I put up with bullshit? Absolutely not. Through allowing them to continue being who they were, but drawing the line specifically with myself I've had a wonderful time adapting and learning my trade more through excellent and skilled tradesmen who are without a doubt more than rough around the edges. I am an atheist in the bible belt and while my beliefs are not ""approved of"" they have been respectfully mentioned when directly required. I'm not going around making it a point everyone knows, but if asked to participate in anything related to Christianity I openly decline and have received no repercussions. I think this may be a valuable point. Forcefully announcing your differences and opinions may be frowned upon rather than just bringing it up when relevant. 

Out of the 4 women who entered my trade schooling only two of them were successful and the two that were definitely fit the tomboy description. They could identify a lot with the type of male that is successful in this industry. I feel as though there are certain personalities required to succeed in any sort of industry. Is this just inherently bad in your opinion? The ability to adapt is a requirement in all social interactions.

So I guess giving that long pointless anecdote I've come to ask:

Who's responsibility is it to accommodate? The culture already in place in an environment or the individual entering the culture? I think there is definitely some reasonable accommodation to made for both sides. I do wholly believe that there is a heavier responsibility to person entering to have a likable personality in that environment to have a pleasant working environment.

114,How can I introduce feminism in my muslim community?,"Hello everyone,

I live in North Africa, in a country considered as one of the most secular and progressive muslim countries.

But of course patriarchy is still very much an issue here, as an example, I was once escorting a friend from germany to the bus station, and some older men asked me what she was doing, I explained that she was travelling solo on her bicycle\(for longer distances she puts it in the bus\).

One commented that if his daughter did the same he would slaughter her.

Of course it's not the case with everyone, but for the regions where islamic and arabic culture is ingrained deeply it is the status quo and it is rarely discussed.

The issue is that the overwhelming majority of feminists are discussing issues that are not really relevant to most of us.

For example on reddit racial privilege is referred to as ""white"" privilege excluding any non\-white majority countries from the discussion, and also generally the issues discussed are more about micro\-agressions than agression.

Would you happen to know of any online feminist communities that are a bit more ""hardcore""?

117,why is it so hard to agree that Legal prostitution is going to save women/man?,"[https://i.redditmedia.com/pzE4Y0Bf\-8HqoepwgkaVP2uJtB7ZzZqQVxZiAzOkwkE.jpg?s=f5ff91090e38e581fe148bd96903f8d1](https://i.redditmedia.com/pzE4Y0Bf-8HqoepwgkaVP2uJtB7ZzZqQVxZiAzOkwkE.jpg?s=f5ff91090e38e581fe148bd96903f8d1)

despite the harsh language and hateful way of talking. I can understand the points, from what I've read and learned over the years. prostitution does exist in nature, from female penguins who need rocks to build their nests, to Chimpanzee who learned how to use coins to get food. later on they gave those coins to female Chimpanzee for sex, and the female Chimpanzee exchanged the coins for food.

and despite paying for a date not directly being about ""having sex"". it's always there inside our human brain, because if that girl had a penis instead of a vagina, most man would refuse to go on a date in the first place.

these are all facts, unquestionable for the very reason that we can see them every day. we don't consider paying for sex vs going out to a club and buying a girl drinks, because we stand firmly on the moral high ground. but that's the problem, because there isn't really any morality system, we made it up.

there wasn't prostitution in the wild west before women invented it \(so to speak\). infact in those times prostitution made women so much money, they were in charge. and they used that money to build schools for children, safe houses for people and simply made the entire area a better place \(all proven facts from history, you can google it if you wish to do so\)

the problem with trying to stop prostitution is that women themselves will invent it, again and again. because if someone can make money out of something, it's gonna happen. you will never be able to stop prostitution because we are not living in a cartoon. this shitty evil thing have existed since for ever, it's in nature. we can keep teaching people whatever, but this is not going to go away even in 500 years. 

I've read every piece of ""for"" and ""against"" I could find these last few years. and come to understand that prostitution works like any other market. drug cartels wouldn't be doing shit if the government decided to allow drugs \(all of them\). they don't because it's to much of a risk, and ofc their drugs make them money. no one cares marijuana can solve many problems, the pharmaceuticals company controls us with an iron fist. money is worth more than human life, that is a fact. sex trafficking would be gone for the simple reason that the government doesn't fuck around when it comes to their money.

in established places of conduct women are safer and have work benefits. wanna quit? go ahead, there is no pimp to hold you back. no one is in the business of bringing women forcefully from another country, because there is no money in that. the government holds all the cards, you think a pimp is going to survive long because he and his prostitutes want to avoid taxes? the cops will be at their door in less than a week. because again, the government doesn't fuck around when it comes to their money.

we are all against prostitution for morality and human rights reasons, and in doing so we basically hurt more women than we save. we will never be able to allow child prostitution, which is why this is something we can never fully stop. but with adult agreement in a safe place to pay for sex, we have one less thing to deal with. don't get me wrong, I'm against prostitution, but so far we didn't do shit. sex trafficking is alive and kicking more than ever, you just can't fight a market. if there is money to be made from something, someone is going to be there. giving all the power to the government will solve problems, not all of them, but enough to save a lot of lives.

being against prostitution just because it's bad is a foolish choice. you're basically sentencing many women to a shitty life. I've seen enough places in the world where prostitution is legal, and it's almost always the same. women are safer, the man are safer, and all those evil people who abuse women are elsewhere, because the market is already taken.",AskFeminists,1528004629,blackalfina,37,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8o6lk0/why_is_it_so_hard_to_agree_that_legal/,2018-06-03

141,Are hypergamous heterosexual women contributing to patriarchy?,"Hello everyone,

Had an Aha moment recently, about how the way we chose our partners might be contributing to patriarchy.

(This idea only applies to heterosexual parents.)

Our society is challenging gender roles that have been enforced by patriarchy since the start of civilization, where the man is the lead bread winner and the woman is the lead caregiver.

It is challenging, and changing, those gender roles by encouraging mothers to become the lead bread winners and fathers to become the lead caregivers, and many couples are thriving thanks to this.

However, hypergamy in women is still very common, and due to this, men who are willing to be the lead caregivers are not seen as masculine/attractive.

Hence, hypergamy encourages men who want to be seen as masculine/attractive to be the lead bread winners.

149,"Feminism in Films Question: ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a film by a Japanese director based on a book by a British author. Both have stated that feminism is the primary theme. Viewing it from that perspective I was still quite confused and would appreciate your insight?","I would be interested in going back and reviewing it with a fresh perspective. I admit that I have not read the book, but I have heard that it does differ from the film. I am trying to understand some of the central feminist themes, and divide those in context to the cultural differences of English female author's and the Japanese male director's personal/gender/cultural differences.


TBH it did not seem particularly feminist in general. The love story elements were somewhat standard if not anti-feminist to my perspective. The most interesting element was that the protagonist changes ages frequently and I can't tell if those were as a statement to the changing situation or were random. I feel like there is meaning there I am just not grasping. The part that I thought was the most interesting was the relationship that Sophie had with The Witch of the Wastes.

1,Accidentally Contracted MRA,"So I've been working on making a video game for several years and I reached a point where I needed to hire an outside programmer for a new feature. He had nothing but great reviews on the game dev forum I've been working in, and seemed nice and polite. 

I hired him, the work went well, and I got the feature I'd been too stuck to finish myself. Then, a few months after the work was done, I searched his username because I forgot what country he was from and wanted to grab it from his profile, but then I saw his post history for the first time. And it turns out he's an MRA. 

I was shocked and extremely upset, since my game is heavily centered on marginalized narratives. (The main character, like me, is an autistic trans person, and there's a lot of queer romance routes.) I just started feeling like my game is tainted. I wish I had done better research before hiring him, not just looking at reviews of his work. I understand the importance of giving jobs to marginalized folks, and wish I'd just looked harder to find a trans programmer to hire.

Now it's been months and I haven't been able to work on my game since. I really don't want to leave it unfinished, I put years into it, but I can't afford to hire someone to recode that section, and if I do finish it with his code I'll have to put him in the credits. I don't want him to use his work in my game as a defense of his character, like ""look, I'm not an MRA, I did work on this progressive game!"" I feel guilt over saving all that money and spending it on someone like that, but I'm disabled, living on social security, and have no way to just get the money back when I already received the code and it works.

5,The incels thing has me wondering about my place in the world,"First: I am deeply sorry if I violate any rules or norms.  I am honestly not trying to, but I am fairly new to reddit, and certainly to this subreddit.   I'm going to be baring my soul, in complete honesty, so it will ramble and be stream\-of\-consciousness. I apologize in advance. When asked ""what is the purpose of this meandering horror of a post"", the answer is – I think – to find a way to define my place in the world, and my viewpoints. 

I'd like to share a viewpoint here, and although I feel certain it's probably not going to be very popular, I would be grateful if people were to read it all the way through and give it serious consideration. Please understand that I am not trying to complain about anything in any way. I am trying to tell my tale, and hope that it brings some understanding...and maybe get some useful advice in the process.

I have what feel – to me at least – to be complicated feelings on gender relations. They are complicated because I honestly believe in equality for *everyone*, regardless of \[insert distinguishing characteristic here\]. Unfortunately \(for me at least\), ""equality isn't enough"": a concept about which I'm far more ambivalent. 

I believe I have lived long enough to see myself become a villain.

Honestly, I've largely come to terms with being a villain. I was angry about it at first, but I now mostly accept that this is how it is. Western society has become hyeprpartisan on almost every front, there isn't a lot of room for shades of grey – at least in large scale public discussions – and so someone like me, with various neuroses, intertwining views, fears and so forth is not going to be considered a ""good guy"". I'm okay with that.

But I'm also looking, perhaps, for some help in finding other villains like me. I know that I will never be a ""feminist"" by the modern definition, but I also don't identify with the ""redpilled"" types. I don't know what people who think like me are called, or even where to begin looking to find them…excepting that I suspect many of the feminists in this subreddit encounter folks like me on a regular basis, and maybe can point me to a ""safe space"" for lapsed ""feminist\-ally men"" who just couldn't change fast enough to still have that term applied to them.

The ""incels"" thing that has recently been in the news is a great starting point for discussion. It serves to highlight some fairly complicated \(maybe ""twisted"" is a better term?\) thinking and emoting that I feel  makes a great example of just how difficult is seems to be to settle on terminology to self\-indentify.

**Incels** 

One of the things that has been repeated throughout numerous threads in this subreddit is that ""incels"" feel ""entitled"" to sex. I'd like to simultaneously challenge this and agree with it, which is where the ""reading all the way through"" portion of the equation comes in.

 I think of myself as ""involuntarily celibate"", but I would also say that I don't really associate that concept with the group of individuals who call themselves ""incels"", have a subreddit, cheer terrorists, and so forth. I don't believe that I am entitled to sex, or affection, or really all that much of anything. Despite this, I would absolutely like to be having oh, just a heck of a lot more sex than I do. But even this is really quite complicated.

 I don't want to want sex. I enjoy sex. I especially enjoy giving other people pleasure in a sexual context. But I also feel pretty sure that I will never be able to satisfy my desires for sex. To be more accurate, I don't believe that I am capable of obtaining sex. There are numerous reasons for this that range from anxiety disorders to being outrageously fat, and if given the choice I would really like a magic button that could carve out the desire for sex from my biology so that I never felt the urge, noticed women in a sexual fashion, or otherwise had to waste mental energy on sex ever again.

 I have talked with both men and women about their sex drives and my current understanding is that not all individuals feel sexual urges at the same rate of frequency or strength. I, personally, feel a drive for sex that can only be described as overwhelming and distracting. Given that my wife and I engage in sexual activities about once ever two years or so, suffice it to say that my biological imperatives are not silenced. Masturbation can quiet the roar a little, but there is a distinct difference between it and actual sex.

 None of the above, however, means that I feel *entitled* to sex. I am, by the very definition of the words, involuntarily celibate. I want to have more sex than I do, and the ""dry spells"" can last years. There's nothing voluntary about this.

**The Dating Game**

 So, if I am so hard up for sex, why don't I just go get some, I hear you say? To answer that, I'd like to put this in a larger context. Even assuming that I could magically melt off the considerable weight, overcome all of my anxiety issues and manage to find a way to figure out the dating metagame that I've been out of for the past decade, I wouldn't. This is because I am *terrified* of everything involving gender relations now.

If I say or do the wrong thing, even with the best of intentions, a woman who feels slighted can end my career overnight. Heck, they can do that even if I don't say or do anything wrong. And yes, I'm aware of all the various statistics about false accusation, and I'm aware of the shifting social mores that put the onus on me to know everything there is to know about non\-verbal cues, to never do anything that could be even remotely perceived as misconduct etc. 

The problem is: I'm terrible at *non\-verbal* cues. I also catch myself doing things like staring at an attractive lady, largely against my will: my brain and body seem to do this for at least several seconds before my conscious mind kicks in and says ""no, don't do that"". I realize many of you will not believe this, as there seems to be a general belief that all of us are in constant, conscious control of everything we do, all the time, but that just isn't how it works for me.

 I stare a lady's cleavage without meaning to. I stumble, and stammer, and sometimes say things I shouldn't. I'm awkward, and after 35 years on this planet, I still don't know how to make that any better.

**Statistics Have Little Impact On Emotions**

Thanks to the seeming inability of modern ""outing"", I live in pants\-wetting terror of simple mistakes. \(Thanks, anxiety disorders!\) A one in a billion chance that a woman might consider trying to ruin me for being awkward is still 7.5 people. A one in a million chance is 7500 people. Were I single, I might roll those dice, but I have a wife and pets to look out for, and I care about them very, very much...and I feel unable to take even that tiny level of risk that my income might be removed from caring for my family. The loss of my income would mean the loss of the condo, and likely my wife's clinical depression going to some very bad places in a right hurry.

\(Side note: I'm exceptionally glad that my wife still gets to be awkward and make mistakes while dating. Admittedly, she targets different women than I do, but it does mean that she has a better chance of getting laid by someone who interests her on a regular basis. I hope some sort of lesbian/bisexual anti\-misconduct movement never emerges that makes ladies feel that they can't make mistakes around other ladies. That would be really bad.\)

So the long story short here is that sex just isn't a thing that's going to happen for me. It's not voluntary on my part. I'm involuntarily celibate. In part because I can't attract a sexual partner, in part because my anxiety disorders mean that I feel I cannot take the risk of seeking out sexual partners, given that there exists an even infinitesimal chance that doing so would jeopardize my ability to provide for those I care about.

I am thus \- in my own mind at least \- an involuntary celibate. I don't feel I am owed sex. I don't feel I am owed friendship, or anything else. But I am do not view myself as celibate by choice.

**Being A Horrible Person**

 Now perhaps others will say ""well, but you are celibate by choice"", and proceed to pick apart the above in an attempt to detail how horrible of a person I am, and how all my life choices are wrong, and I deserve to die sad and alone in a gutter. This is the internet. That sort of thing happens all the time.

 What I am hoping to convey with my meandering post, however, is that the mindset of at least *some* individuals who think of themselves as ""involuntary celibates"" isn't rooted in misogyny, hatred of women, or a sense of entitlement. Some of us, at least, just have annoying, overwhelming desires for sex and have no practical means to sate \- or in many cases even quiet \- those desires.

 Involuntary celibacy combines with ""toxic masculinity"" in the form of our collective measuring of male status vis\-a\-vis that male's ability to obtain regular \(and divers\) sex. The result is even lower self esteem and a deepening of social anxieties which in turn make obtaining sex more difficult. The result of that is frequent \- or in my case, functionally *constant* \- suicidal ideation. It's not a pleasant headspace to be in...but it's also not necessarily one based in selfishness or entitlement either.

 I understand that it is easy to lump all ""incels"" together into one neat package. Humans like to make neat little categories, and none of us really like treating people as individuals, each with separate hopes, dreams, motivations, desires, and so forth. In doing so, however, I feel that the same fundamental issue that the ""toxic"" incels make is being repeated: treating a group of people as homogenous and interchangeable. And I don't think that this ultimately helps anyone, especially when a broad diversity of thought exists within that group.

 As a parting thought, I'd like to add that it is entirely possible to view people both as \(sexual\) objects, and as people. For those of us who aren't wedded \(pun not intended\) to the traditional ideas of monogamy, we can \(and often do\) view sexual enjoyment as separate from long term emotional relationships.

 Personally, I find peak sexual enjoyment from knowing that the other participant\(s\) in my sexual endeavors are themselves achieving enjoyment, but that level of interconnected emotional reactivity exists separately from the emotional entanglements of a relationship, at least for me. I realize it's not the sexual\-emotional approach for everyone, but it's my truth. And yes, I am cheered \- not made jealous \- when my wife finds a new sexual partner. Because I love her, and am I glad to see her finding joy in this world.

 The idea that we are all alike, or all easily labeled, quantified, dismissed or interchangeable is, in my humble opinion, at the very core of many and varied social and interpersonal problems. But I don't know how to describe that. I don't know how to talk about it.

I don't know what label I am. I know that I am not a feminist by modern definitions: equity instead of equality, for example, seems to be a barrier for me in at least some practical implementations. But I also can't accept that I am an outright misogynist either; I feel there's a difference between my outlook on the world and the ""incels"" who cheered the anti\-women terrorists…even if I view myself as ""involuntarily celibate"".

So where do I find people like me? A place to belong? Maybe the chance to not feel so crushingly lonely, and be ""just a guy"", without also having to be a villain?  A place where it's okay to have desires and to try to help others meet their own desires, without either of those things being inherently bad?  Or, if such a place doesn't exist, can someone wave a magic wand and take away my desire for sex, and somehow make me okay with the rapidly changing cacophony of shifting expectations that I only barely understand?  

At the end of the day, I'm just tired of always being so afraid. Of judgement. Of retribution for awkwardness. Of bullies big and small. I just want to know where I go so that I can spend some time with my guard down.  I don't want to hurt others, but I also don't want to be hurt, especially as I stumble through life without answers, without a map, and making  a very human amount of mistakes along the way.

9,How do I stop slut-shaming?,"[ADVICE ONLY, NO JUDGEMENT]

I cannot help but hate women who engage in premarital sexual intercourse, but I am completely fine with men who do. In fact, I encourage and applaud it. I think the reason is primarily because of gender differences. It can be chalked up to this quote by Jim Jefferies:

""Every single time a man sleeps with a lot of women, he’s called a stud. But if a woman sleeps with a lot of men, she’s called a slut, and people think this is unfair… Nah. It’s completely fair, and I’ll tell you why, alright? ‘Cause it’s fuckin’ easy to be a slut. It’s fuckin’ hard to be a stud. To be a stud you have to be witty, charming, be well-dressed, have nice shoes, and a fake job. To be a slut you just have to be there. There are fat ugly sluts out there, there are no fat ugly studs.""

Ultimately, men having sex is a victory whereas it is not the same for women. 

Bottom line for me is this: Female virginity should be cherished. You wouldn't want another man's previous clothes so why would you want another man's previous girlfriend? How can you dedicate yourself to a woman knowing she has been on her knees for several guys getting shot in the face with cum. I just cannot understand. 

I don't want to think this way, but it's VERY difficult not to. Women who have had previous sexual partners have nothing of value to me other than their bodies for one night stands.

I can understand that, statistically, it is overwhelmingly men.

It also seems to ignore homosexual relationships, particularly lesbian, which has a higher rate than heterosexual relationships. I believe that this bias towards men not only hurts heterosexual men who are often arrested for domestic violence despite being the victim, homosexual men as it seems to ignore any abuse there and especially homosexual women since they are more likely to be involved in abuse.

25,Curious question on media depicting women wearing make up in combat.,"Something I've been curious about for a while is how often times in media, female fighters are often depicted as wearing make up, despite the fact that in a combat situation or war zone, there would be no time or need to apply make up.

As some examples, in the cases of Wonder Woman, Valkyrie in Thor Ragnarok, both of them are warrior types who are shown to be wearing make up. And in video games, such as Mass Effect, when people make their Commander Shepard female (Often called Femshep), she is often given make up too, including by girls I know who play the games.

So the thought occurred to me, since all of these are fantastical settings to varying degrees, and are to certain extents power fantasies, because make up is typically seen as a feminine thing, if this i all something that can be seen as empowering femininity. Yeah, there are certainly some, pretty much always men, who do it because it looks hot, but aside from those, is this the appeal to a girl of creating a Commander Shepard wearing a full face of make up and going into battle and kicking ass?",AskFeminists,1525893133,Buccura,16,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8i8ljj/curious_question_on_media_depicting_women_wearing/,2018-05-09

I took a peek into the gender critical subreddit today and was surprised to see the sheer discontentment for liberal feminism there. I mean - some of the posters there didn't even seem to be TERFs themselves, yet they join up with TERF circles for some of these reasons:

1) Their displeasure with liberal feminism, and this subreddit in particular. Hence, they dwell there instead. They use the term LibFem as though it's a slur. Do you folks consider it a slur?

2) Male feminists. Many feel that males cannot be feminists, and are upset with liberal feminism's acceptance of that.

3) Misandry and hate speech. Many of the topics they post there are seeped in hatred of men, and/or transgender people. That is obviously unacceptable in this subreddit, and liberal feminist circles.

4) Their disagreement that feminism should benefit men, or be about equality with men. To many there - feminism is a movement started by women FOR women. (I did note a few opposing replies who mentioned it's about uplifting women to create a female-centered sphere that is valued as much as the male one is; I find this a reasonable stance.)

5) SWERFs. Many there are opposed to all sex work and pornography. Some of them ally with TERFs even though they aren't necessarily transphobic themselves; they just find TERFs more welcoming to them.

33,"Do negative attitudes toward men play a significant role, or only perceptions of women as inferior?","This question's a bit tricky to articulate.

Very often, when people bring up examples of what appears to be sexism toward men, the feminist response *seems* to be ""that's a result of negative attitudes toward women"". I'll give a couple of examples so you know what I'm talking about.

Sentencing disparity: Now I know this one is a bit contentious. [Recent study](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/men-women-prison-sentence-length-gender-gap_n_1874742.html) suggests that western court systems are more lenient on women than on men. I get that the conclusions often drawn from this study are debated, but let's go with it at face value for a moment here. 

Family court: also debated. Hotly. But this one's complicated, and there's good evidence to at least suggest that bias in favour of mothers *does* exist.

Dress codes: girls being sent home from school for dress code violations has become an absurdly familiar thing.

Now what I've seen from feminists is basically this: in the first case, *if* there's a bias in the courts to punish men more harshly, it's because the system sees *women* as inferior; it regards them as having less agency, and sort of infantilizes them. I think this one is particularly contentious because what some men hear is feminists saying ""Oh, you got three years for a crime that a woman only got community service for? Poor baby, stop complaining, that poor woman was *infantilized*!"" Which rings pretty hollow.
 In the second, mothers are favoured in court because women are seen as better caregivers *and should be constrained to that role*. In the third case, it's all about men trying to control what women do with their bodies and policing modesty.

To entertain a different point of view: Perhaps sentencing disparity, if it exists, is as much a product of *unfair attitudes toward men* - that men are inherently dangerous, less capable of remorse, ethically and morally deficient, and less necessary as parents. In Family Court, men are seen as inferior, ""backbencher"" parents, less capable of nurturing and empathy. In the dress code business, perhaps girls are sent home not because anyone really cares what they wear, but because boys are regarded as being so hopelessly at the mercy of their libidos that they can't think about anything else if there's a pretty girl in the room showing a little leg. Because boys are weak-minded neanderthals who are incapable of functioning properly in the presence of an attractive and somewhat exposed female body.

Now, I could see that perhaps when feminists say ""these problems are a result of negative attitudes toward women"", perhaps what is really meant is ""Here's how fixing negative attitudes toward women would *help*"" - not necessarily fix the entire problem. Because yes, fixing those negative attitudes toward women *would* help, but would only get us halfway there. And while feminists might acknowledge that a negative attitude toward men exists, it basically says (fairly) ""That's not our department."" I know many feminists would support a healthy men's movement that could tackle these issues head-on, one that looks nothing like the current MRM and doesn't blame women or feminists for these problems in the first place.

So, then, to the question: Do you agree that these kinds of negative attitudes toward males exist, and are a significant problem, but just aren't really up to feminists to solve? Or do you think that what is perceived as negative attitudes toward men are really just derivatives of negative attitudes toward women, and that the problems men face will be fixed by fixing those negative attitudes?

48,Male and female overlap in athletics - looking for data!,"Hey all - TL;DR - looking for a decent source of data that actually shows full trends of women vs male athletes not just record holders for a debate with peers (IE I'm not looking for anyone to do my homework for me)
I'm trying to argue the point that if all athletics were open to men and women without sexism ""holding women back"" that there would be more women who could compete at a professional level against male athletes. I understand bimodal sexual dimorphisms and I'm not saying that women would suddenly hold all the world records (as they suggested back in the 1980s/90s) or that NFL teams would be 50% female but that there would be at least anywhere from 1-10% women qualifying and competing in various professional sports with men if provided equal opportunity. My peers are arguing that in almost any professional sport ""people actually care about"" there would be NO women who would be able to even qualify for mens teams. (I'm ignoring the argument that the sports ""we actually care about"" already being those that preference biologically male traits which is just one more example of sexism in athletics - anyway)

As far as ""removing sexism"" I mean that if from day 1 women would have the same access to practical and financial athletics resources; were treated the same by coaches, peers, external support; were able to train in equally competitive environments; didn't have the additional psychological baggage of being told they couldn't etc etc etc

What support I have been able to find is how once certain barriers to women's sports were removed their records increased almost exponentially until plateauing about 10 years ago (ie showing sexism DOES make a difference in athletic performance) and one article about ski racing that does show overlap in men and women olympic average speeds (mens bottom times around the women's median - women's top times around the men's median) in addition to mentioning that once women were allowed to compete on longer/steeper tracks their times actually did improve (once again - by not allowing women to compete at the same level they're being held back.)
However the vast majority of literature is heavily biased in only comparing record holders using women's records being lower as an argument for not being able to compete at all (ignoring the fact that ~99% of the male competitors have no chance of hitting those records either....) Furthermore - if they DO compare top women record holders to qualifying standards for men - its almost exclusively in sports where other athletic factors could not close biological strength gaps any further. ie various field and track sports were female records are don't make men's qualifying times/scores etc generally heavily rely on quick, forceful use of muscle mass - there was even one study that showed in events such as this women's records were consistently ~8-10% lower than male records which I think makes sense if you think about the tail ends of sex differences - BUT these factors don't contribute equally in all sports. 

So what I'm looking for is any data of professional athletes that actually considers overlaps in strength, speed, etc not just record times which are explained away as ""outliers"". I've only been able to find a few graphs on ski racing and one article that showed the top 5 ski jumpers would have placed in the top 15 men. 

If anyone has more experience in this topic that could point me in the direction of helpful literature they've seen or what search phrases they would use to look for this. (I have access to several databases - not just google haha)

Sorry for the wall of text. I just think it's an interesting topic that explores accepting where at the extremes of human fitness there are sex differences but showing the line between that and where sexism plays a role instead - and while I can find inferences and snippets (as well as cracks in opposing data where the argument doesn't support the conclusions) I like having more concrete evidence and examples to think about especially when the majority of material out there is secondary and even tertiary material just arguing about record breaking.

57,"Against men, it isn't oppression - so what could we call it?","So a lengthy argument ensued in a different thread about ""oppression"" of men, and brought up this question for me.

No one seems to dispute that there *are* negative attitudes toward men that exist \- some of these are the flipside of poor perceptions of women, and some may be something else. And these attitudes toward men do hurt men. Feminists seem to pretty much unanimously agree that ""patriarchy hurts everyone"", men included. So to give some examples of what I'm talking about, for instance, when men are presumed to be predators around small children \(shifty looks at the park when watching their own kids, having security called taking their own kids to the bathroom \- yes, this stuff happens\). 

A more common example is the expectation placed on them to handle big problems themselves, without complaining or asking for support. I've seen this just called ""toxic masculinity"", but that seems misapplied here \- if a man is being emotionally expressive or asking for help, *he* is not displaying toxic masculinity, and if those shaming or criticising him are women \(which is often the case\), they can't really be said to be displaying it either. Something else is happening \- there's a destructive* expectatio*n. Toxic masculinity is a term that has its own application, but I see it more as useful for describing p*oor behav*iour displayed my men themselves, not something that can be used to describe the expectations put on them by others \(especially women\), or the attitudes toward them.

And we could get into family court, sentencing, other issues in which men are \(arguably, not unquestionably\) disadvantaged.

I agree that none of this amounts to *oppression*. Men are not being oppressed. I would call it sexism, or perhaps misandry. But those have come under fire because so many people insist that to be those things, the attitudes would have to work systemically, and it's argued that they don't.

So let's say men want to sit down and have their own conversation about these things, independant of women's issues, and perhaps outside of the framework of feminism \(though not necessarily against it\). When these negative attitudes toward men come out, and hurt men, it isn't oppression \- but it's certainly *something.* As I mentioned, just calling it ""toxic masculinity"" is insufficient, because the problem often isn't anyone's ""masculinity"" of any sort. It's a whole set of expectations, some of which are too high, and some of which are way t*oo *low, that hurt men. So what could we call it in this conversation? Is there a word that could be reasonably applied? To constantly say ""negative attitudes toward men"" is cumbersome \(and a pain in the ass to type\).

That inequality shows how deep it goes, what a deep part of yourself that has been systemically warped, insidiously, your deep joy of reading the goal of an omnipresent, oppressive force. Think of language.

Imagine if the world had only ever known one language, how difficult it would be to think of a new one from scratch! And feminists did, they were the prisoners in Plato's cave who guessed the flames they were looking at was really a fire behind them. But then, the next challenge, once you realize to do so, is how could you construct anything else? And as invisible and insidious as the Patriarchy is, how could one build anything outside its influence?

How much of feminism is truly free from its influence?

How far does awareness go? How much of feminism is defined by the patriarchy, even among feminists? To be in opposition of something is to be shaped by -- feminism is centered fully on the patriarchy. If the patriarchy is so intense as to affect even the youngest children in how they play by mere presence, what do you think effect the patriarchy has upon those want to beat it by bringing it in full conscious awareness as frequently as possible?

Someone like Chris Brown, whose music I never enjoyed, is easy for me to ignore, especially since I've seen the photos of what he did to Rhianna. And it's easy for me to avoid watching something of Bill Cosby's, because of the sheer number of women he's abused.  
But when you keep looking, there are so many artists who have done these things and it makes it difficult to listen to any music or watch TV without supporting someone problematic.  Michael Jackson, Led Zeppelin, Fall Out Boy, Woody Allen, Wagner, etc.

75,[MAJOR SPOILERS] Question about the movie Arrival?,"If you haven't seen the movie and aren't worried about the major spoilers up ahead, or just need a refresher, here is a rundown on the background you need to know for my question:

In the movie, a woman named Louise learns an alien language that rewires her brain, thus ultimately allowing her to see time in a nonlinear fashion (e.g. and most relevantly, into the future).

In this way, she learns that she will have a daughter with another character, a man named Ian, and that this daughter will die of an untreatable disease as a teenager. Through flashforwards, it is revealed that she says ""yes"" to his question of whether she wants to ""make a baby,"" but does not initially tell him of her knowledge of these events. After some time, when the child is around six/seven, she tells him, and he leaves her, quoted as saying she ""made the wrong choice"" in not telling him beforehand.

I am just curious as to whether this would classify as rape, as it is implied Ian would not have brought the child into the world had he known she would die so soon, and thus Louise was privy to withheld information that would have changed his decision about having unprotected sex and from there starting a family with her.

Additionally, it does not seem as though Louise is predestined to the fate of not telling Ian as she later admits to her daughter that him leaving was her fault, though then again she could have been fated to make what she later considered a mistake. But in either case, would that change the classification of her actions as or not as rape?

Thanks all. Was rewatching this movie earlier today and concluded myself that her not telling him was immoral, but was unsure of whether it was rape.",AskFeminists,1526408024,earthlingrush,5,6,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8jns4d/major_spoilers_question_about_the_movie_arrival/,2018-05-15

77,Help! I don't want to be a TERF! RE: trans women &amp; male privilege,"\(Extremely long preamble starts...\) I consider myself relatively well\-read on feminist issues and think of myself of as an intersectional feminist who still fucks up often. I am truly not trolling here and haven't been able to find a space anywhere online where I can discuss this and it is preventing me from gaining a full understanding and acceptance of the issue and shedding any bullshit views I have grown up with.     I have spent a lot of time googling this but unfortunately I can't seem to find things that aren't either from a TERF point of view or from a trans woman's point of view and I really want to hear from people who don't have a vested interest in their own cause \(yeah i can hear how problematic that sounds\). Also I really don't want anyone to engage in any emotional labour they don't feel up to \-  I really hate the idea of burdening someone like that, which is a big part of why I haven't asked this question before. I am hoping there are people who aren't directly affected by this question who are willing to take the time to engage because I don't want to demand the labour of trans people who deal with this kind of stuff enough. \(/End of long preamble\)  

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

   Question: How have trans women who transitioned later in life not experienced male privilege?      \(I am not referring to women who started transitioning in some way before/during puberty here, only to those who maintain the trappings of looking like men into adulthood. I am also very aware that trans people experience a huge amount of oppression and violence. I also believe that trans women are real women but I struggle with the idea that there aren't practical differences in the lived experiences trans women and cis women have, just as a white woman does not have the same experience as a WOC\)      I have been agonizing over this for years and have discussed it with feminist friends and most don't have a good response for me when I bring up my points. The one that does basically says that trans women find being treated as a man oppressive and thus didn't experience it as privilege, but I have a hard time completely accepting that because much of the time, the privilege you receive is invisible and not marked obviously. I doubt that at job interviews male\-presenting people who are offered the job assume it was due to their perceived maleness, and obviously there are thousands of these kinds of examples of privilege. That's sort of the whole problem of privilege: you don't perceive you have any sort of advantages over other people. Sure, there are the obvious things that male\-presenting trans women would have experienced with men and other women assuming they're men that specifically address their perceived gender, and that would obviously be incredibly oppressive and difficult, but those larger, simple structural privileges that affect your day\-to\-day life are still there. I don't for a second deny that the internal pain and agony and frustration a trans person experiences isn't monumental, either. I don't want to minimize a trans person's experience with gender dysphoria and all the hell our society foists upon non\-cis people.     When I read about privilege and see identity politics discussions progress, much of the time the concept of passing comes into play. If you pass as the identity being privileged, you experience that privilege, as privilege has more to do with how the rest of the world perceives you, and not how you actually identify. I have tried to think of analogous situations and the closest I can think of is white\-passing people who are mixed. They experience white privilege in many ways despite carrying a POC identity which can leave them with many race\-related struggles that are decidedly not privileged. I get the impression that passing can highly impact the intersections you live at, and I struggle to see how trans women are exempt from those intersections.       I have also seen a number of accounts of trans men who, post\-transition admit to receiving male privilege, so how does the same in reverse not apply to trans women? These same men  acknowledge there are losses of things they associated with their feminine identity/ways of thinking as they transition, so why don't trans women have losses of these male things as well? It just seems so strange to me that trans men and trans women have seem to have such different perceptions and experiences of privilege pre\-and\-post transition, which further entrenches me in my point of view. I've never seen a trans man argue he didn't experience sexism pre\-transition.       Can someone please provide me links to thoughtful reading that will help me understand how I'm wrong? I've read pretty much all the top google article searches on the subject and haven't been convinced. But I want to! I friggin hate TERFs and just want to be rid of this one problematic view I have with respect to trans people.

80,"Questions from a cisgendered, (personally considers themselves 'woke') white (as far as being of Irish decent is considered white) heterosexual male who feels that he is in a 'no win' situation.","As my title gives a bit of my bio away, I will just get to the point of my question: other than governing my actions and statements (and vote for progressive candidates in elections) WTF can I do because every other week/day/(just take my word for it it is quite frequent) I am accused or commented to that because I am a white male I am inherently sexist and racist???

I have always thought you should just treat people as people. I don't understand Third or Forth Wave Feminism because from where I sit they don't have a specific agenda (apart from exposing rape culture and sexual criminals, which I think is great). I come from a background where I had a mother with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and as a result I was psychologically abused every day until I cut off contact (a joint AMA and APA study in 2014 measured the negative health effects of different types of abuse - physical, sexual, and psychological - and determined that psychological abuse has equal negative effects as the combination of sexual and physical abuse - http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/10/psychological-abuse.aspx) so I have come to the conclusion that abuse (also sexism and racism) can be a two-way street (in short, no gender is incapable of evil acts).

So with this background I treat women and men that I encounter as people, but it doesn't seem enough. When I ask a question about someone's culture recently (his family was from India and I asked if he knew why there were two Delhi's) I was told that ""my privileged was showing"". If I can't ask people from other cultural backgrounds questions how HTF am I supposed to learn anything about them?

I just feel that I am in a no-win situation: I feel I am called sexist and racist regardless of my actions and anytime I try and ask an honest question to learn more about other people I am told am privileged, and if I don't I am ignorant. What am I supposed to do? Some  advice would be appreciated.

PS: the reason I mention the Irish element is for about 700-800 years (depending on your historical interpretation) Ireland was colonized by England and suffered what can only be described as pogroms, racist laws (look up the Penal Laws, they were the British equivalent of the Nuremberg Laws the Nazis put in place), property confiscation, ethnic cleansing (Irish cleared out of areas so that English and Scottish settlers could be placed there), transporting to be used in indentured servitude in the New World under Cromwell, racist labour and housing policies (Irish Need Not Apply was a thing), religious discrimination (no Irish Catholics could vote or hold office for centuries), lack of political rights, and (based on the UN 1947 definition) acts of genocide in the Potato Famines (there were three). The question of at what point did Irish become 'white' is debated by historians.

87,"Why is saying 'men are trash' deemed ok, even celebrated?","That's become such a common expression to see online these days but it seems so mean spirited and hypocritical and it's always so depressing to see it so openly supported and promoted. To generalize and insult people based on their gender seems antifeminist to me and I realize inequalities still exist all over but it rightfully would never be tolerated if something like that were said about women. 

I've heard it said that it's actually calling toxic masculinity trash or calling what society says a man should be trash but why not say that instead, why unnecessarily generalize and put down so many people based on just their gender? I know some people say that it only refers to 'bad men', that the 'not all' part is supposed to be assumed and if you're not a trash person then you shouldnt be offended. But there's always so many women who insist that it truly does refer to all men. They make the argument that men rape and kill and responsible for everything bad in the world but would never acknowledge any of the good men have and continue to do for the world. I grew up hearing about how feminism was for everyone and while it affected women moreso, the patriarchy was also hurting men but now men are all trash and screw them? Is that really what feminism is today, women = good and men = bad?

If it's supposed to be a critique of masculinity it doesnt come across that way at all, it only ever sounds like 'I hate all men and dont think they should be treated with the respect and human decency that I should be treated with'. Should men just accept that we should try to make our society equal but also women should have a free pass to insult them as much as they want and men are not allowed to be offended or ever insult back? 

I feel like little girls are going to hear it and take away that they should generalize men as a group and not like or respect the other gender as human beings deserve to be respected and little boys are going to hear it and feel like women all hate them and they're supposed to feel ashamed and bad about themselves because of their gender. It's not going to make anyone reexamine anything, it just comes across as an attack. This slogan isnt going to make me not be a feminist but it seems so unnecessary to insult and generalize so many people if the message is really about critiquing toxic masculinity.

Are men trash in your eyes for being born men? Do you mean 'all' or 'some' men when you use the slogan? What would your reaction be to someone who said 'women are trash' be? Is there any way to get out the same message without insulting and dehumanizing everyone of an entire gender? Does society teach men to be trash and is calling men trash the best way to correct that?

89,how to talk to my feminist identifying female friend about her overly aggressive sexual advances towards men,"I have a new but good friend who is a proud and vocal feminist. she's a very supportive and loving friend to me who has gone out of her way to help me when I'm struggling or in a bad spot and I greatly appreciate her for how much I can rely on her. but her actions sometimes veer from being very pro-women into just man-hating sometimes. she's also very sexually aggressive with men. I have no issues with sleeping around but she sleeps around A LOT. she averages more 1 new guy a week and has several guys she sleeps with regularly on top of that and she speaks pretty poorly about the men she sleeps with, saying they're essentially just dildos to her and that she just uses them to get off and doesn't care about them. she also recently slept with my friend while he was barely able to stay conscious and he told his flatmates the next day she raped him bc he didn't want to have sex with her that night. additionally she makes crude comments to the guy I've been seeing for over 7 months now (we aren't exclusive but still don't like the idea of my close friends making passes at him) and has apparently tried to grab him through his pants before. which made him insanely uncomfortable as he has no interest in her and the guy she raped is his good friend/flatmate. however she's never done anything like this towards him in front of me, which also makes me uncomfortable bc then it feels like she's being shady. 

I want to talk to her about this behavior because it's inappropriate and also, as a survivor of sexual violence, its triggering to see such sexual aggression and lack of consideration for other people's bodily autonomy. but this doesn't feel like an easy thing to talk to someone about so I'm feeling a bit lost on how to go about it.

90,"Has ""sex positive"" ideology been corrupted and can it still be useful?","I'm very outspoken against ""sex-positive feminism"", but, I'm really not that against **actual** sex-positivity. Women's sexuality has been, and continues to be, repressed in society, with women's sexuality and sexual needs and desires being shamed and denied. I think it's extremely valuable to have a movement aimed at helping women reclaim their sexuality in a society where the only acceptable avenue for women's sexuality is being commodified and sold to men. 

So how come instead of doing that, sex positive feminism promotes the commodification of women's sexuality for men? Why does sex positive feminism come across as part of the men's rights movement instead? 

Sex positive ideology is used to defend men who use pornography, defend men who use prostitutes, defend men who ask for anal and defend female submissiveness. Feminists used to fight against objectification but under sex positive ideology it's empowering to be nothing more than a hole to have sex with. 

So my question is really do you think that the sex positive ideology has stopped fighting for women's sexual freedom and started forcing women back into the patriarchal molds for our sexuality, and is there a way to get it back on track?

102,Help me out please.,"Possibly the wrong place - I'm a man, who has been in a relationship with a woman until recently. We are 31 - I would consider myself third wave, she is slightly more radical second wave. I'm monogamous, but would say I am sex positive, she definitely delves deeper into the power structures of sex and agency which has always created a friction in our relationship.

During our relationship, we have invited others into it, however we had been monogamous for the most part. We have liked to party on occasion and enjoy mdma as a point of choice to which on several occasions she had been known to take way too much and by all accounts has explored her poly side - ie without communication thrown herself at people, in front of me or not, but usually in an environment which has allowed for me to let her know it's not quite warranted by any party. The next day she has not remembered or has denied it taking place. 

Recently we have broken up, we hung out a few weeks later - mollied up (this isn't a normal thing) I come back and she is making out with someone - I've voiced my chagrin as again this was not communicated and she has told me not to worry and we go home. The next week we hang out and she has called me again obviously high and has asked me to see her at a random third party location. She is obviously high and I pick her up as she is a bit of a mess. We go back to mine, she initiates sex and we do engage. She then tells me she had made out with some person, she didn't want to really but she did anyway. I reacted a bit poorly and told her that she needs to keep her drug taking in check and that I don't like being in a situation like that. She has essentially laughed at me and told me not to be so possessive as this was her life and I can't dictate the terms. 

Cue the problem. Several weeks later - she tells me that she was sexually assaulted by the guy she 'made out' with. 

In telling me my first go to reaction was no, we talked about this - you made out with him and you were high and in fact you laughed at me when I put this to you and maybe as a solution that she needs to keep a check on her drug use. She has then attacked me and said that my reaction is why she hasn't said anything and that it took her several days to process and I have victim blamed her. In response I have told her my side of what happened and she has essentially accused me of centring myself in the position which has affected her entirely. 

I have been okay with her behaviour - I have seen her get wasted and initiate behaviours which she cannot remember therefore to my understanding cannot consent to and have stepped in. I've not passed judgement on this I've been open as I can. After seeing this recent scenario she has found herself in a situation which I assume she may have initiated but in the follow through was not entirely comfortable with and I have pulled her up on it. 

Critique me, assist me, do what you need - my minor moment of doubt has turned me into a larger villain than the accomplice and I need an understanding of where I am at and what I can do to fix this situation as she is extremely isolated.

134,An educational approach to effecting change - useful?,"So I was going back to some of the stuff I learned years ago in Educational Psychology (not an expert, jut took an undergrad course once) and it occurred to me to look at effecting societal change through an educational lens, particularly through Lev Vygotsky's idea of [the Zone of Proximal Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development). I'm wondering if this is an approach that feminists ever apply, or think is at all useful.

For instance: If I work with a man who prides himself on how good he is at cat-calling and thinks that women are incompetent imbeciles who don't think about anything but makeup and suckering in a successful man to provide for them, and honestly believes that feminists are man-haters, then a conversation about privilege, toxic gender norms, and patriarchy is probably going to be lost on him. That material is likely outside of his zone of proximal development - in a way, ""you can't get there from here"". He'd have to be brought along in smaller steps (like, really basic ones). Perhaps the only progress that can be made is by pointing out that when women wake up in the morning, sometimes they've gotta search for a clean pair of socks too, they have to remember to pay their cellphone bill, and that feminists have brothers and fathers, too. In short, you gotta start with ""Women are just people"", and wait for that to sink in before you get to the more academic stuff.

You could apply this to women, too - there are a few women who have a tough time really believing that men have a desire for genuine emotional connections and that they do actually have a lot going on in their minds. With those, we'd have to start with ""men are people, too"" before we get into the effects of toxic masculinity and all the rest.

So an approach like this would involve assessing where someone's currently at, and nudging them toward somewhere they might be able to get to, and accepting that it's not going to be all the way. The thing is, even engaging with people who are this deep into sexist thought is sort of asking a lot, and it can take a huge amount of patience that I can understand many people not really having, especially when the likelihood of any sort of success seems pretty low.

So I'm asking: Is this kind of thinking something feminists apply in everyday interactions? Do you think it's a *useful* way of thinking? Is it asking too much, when patience, time, and resources might be better spent on those with more promising outlooks? Or does it seem too much like ""watering down"" the message?

What defines who is and who is not an SJW?

The boundaries are not clear to me anymore at all, since it seems that people in other countries use the term differently than people do in the USA.

My understanding is that it's a pejorative term invented by right-libertarians on the website 4chan to disparage feminist activism generally.

In my experience leftists use the term themselves to disparage forms of feminism they don't like.

By now it seems to have become a very diffuse term, and I can't tell what the boundaries are.

Are SJW's 'sex-positive' or 'sex-negative' feminists, or perhaps both?

Are some feminist not SJW's?

I'm pro-feminist, but I'm transnational which means I oppose US nationalistic liberal forms of activism.

158,"Do you think in an effort to prop up feminism/women, there is a growing trend of biological/gender essentialism/determinism?","I've learned a lot from this forum, I just wanna say that, you guys are cool.

Anyway, I've noticed that there's a trend recently where, in an effort to support and empower women, there's a growing element of gender essentialism.

For instance, this article (and others on the site) use gendered sterotypes about women being peaceful and nurturing and men being agressive and childish: https://feminismandreligion.com/2018/05/14/women-and-men-in-egalitarian-matriarchy-by-carol-p-christ/

You have the time magazine article about the end of men, and this article 
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/obama-women-superior-men-washing-up-driving-patriarchy&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEv5LgwJrbAhUnwlQKHc2aCdMQFjABegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sQYB9WNEIVoASXKwNGGXa, and others like it recently that use mixture of current statistics about school, biological arguments (testosterone, brain differences), and even diatribes about how women being perseverent makes them better than men as a means to prop them up.

Now, let's get one thing out of the way. I like that women are moving up. I love that women are improving. I feel bad for the ones that are still in dire situations. I am not one of those guys that confuses women empowerment with men falling behind. Im not one of those people that gets butthurt over #yesallmen or #menaretrash.

I just feel like I'm seeing a lot of biological essentialism creep up recently - not necessarily on this forum, but in general. And I have to say I don't like it.

No, I'm notrying one of those people that can't take criticism. I have no problem calling out toxic masculinity, calling rape culture. Have no problem even checking myself on it, and taking criticism.

I just hate the essentialism.
It's damming to apply negative sterotypes as something inherent. I see arguments that are similar to the ones used to demean degrade women for so long, now being used in the opposite way.

Like, I want more female lesdership. But I don't like how it'd being framed in a ""women are more naturally social, kinder, their brains are less aggressive and more cooperative, which is why they are better leaders"" or ""men are worse at child rearing because they lack the empathy and have too much testosterone which makes them probe to violence"" and all that.

It doesn't feel good. It hurts me - and I can only imagine that that is only a fraction of what women have dealt with forever, correct?

It hurts because I'm a guy, and these articles make me feel bad. I'm one of those dudes that's always been more ""neutral"" on the feminine - masculine spectrum. I like sports and all that, dress masculinely, straight, like to gain and build muscle, like having a deep voice, etc.

But I've usually had some feminine/timid characteristics. And surpsingly enough, I've never really been chauvinistic, relative to other guys I know. Ive never really looked down on or belittled girls when I was young, I've never really been the type to say ""lol women are emotional lol"", etc. 

I usually never really had that type of disposition. I've always envisioned having a family, and liked having to opportunity to hug the babies (they're cute!), and all that.

Not stereotypically hypermasculine, right?

So I guess that's why I get more upset than I should be with this articles? I kind of feel bad, useless even when i read them. I already have insecurities, but these articles assume that  guys are just brimming with arrogance, and then blaming every guy (and guys that dont even exist yet) for the actions of lot - and then making as if it's inherent rather than environmental. Just because I'm a guy, it doesn't mean that I inherently will cause violence, it doesn't mean that I can't NURTURE. Just because I have testosterone it doesn't mean that I can't be peaceful. All this essentialism just reinforces gender stereotypes that end up **pigeonholing **people again. Women too.

And that's why I hate it. I read stories about matraiarchies and find it cool how they are peaceful. But I hate the genrealizations that come from them; the praise of them ends up having to generalize men as being *inherently* unsuitable for leadership or peace; that the oprimal situation is for women to lead, because men are inherently incapable of leading, that they don't need to be involved fathers because all they care about is sex, and don't care about/lack instincts in regards to taking care of kids.  I hate that, because its so blatantly backwards, it intentionally ignores socialization, i dont know why. I don't want to live in a place where I can't do what I wanna do just because of preconceptions about me due to my gender. Women have dealt with that long enough, and we shouldn't impose that on anyone for revenge.

So the generalizations hurt more. Im still ambitious, I'm still want to lead - in a peaceful way, and I want to earn it in a fair way. So I can't help but get fucking pissed off sometimes, cause I feel like there's too many characterizations of men *inherently* being simple-minded and mean and unkind and unempathetic, when in reality, socialization plays a role the same way it does for women - yet these articles only want it to go one way. It can be pretty damaging to one's esteem, especially since as a guy, you'll usually be discouraged from showing emotion anyway.

The thing that makes it worse is that I don't know how common this is. It seems like more than a few sites. Im not one of those people that goes scouring the net for negative representations of feminism. Rather, I'm concerned: the feminism on this site is great and something everyone should get behind, but I don't know if the views here are the majority. I usually assume they are, and they probably are: It's just hard to get a consensus on feminist viewpoints - since anyone can call themselves a feminist - so it's hard to know if I just happen to agree with the things here and a few other sites only because they are not hostile/hypocritical, or if because they are actially correct.",AskFeminists,1527037026,bleachbloodable,1,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8lf8u0/do_you_think_in_an_effort_to_prop_up/,2018-05-22

1,Why do some feminists minimize any bad actions committed by women?,"I saw this comment today in a SRS thread, where the topic was women cheating on their husbands in the military:

https://www.np.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/8e6bd7/these_pics_will_be_a_lot_less_cute_after_she/dxst6q0/

&gt;Ah yes. I do love mocking and minimizing a symptom of the extreme emotional distress of having your partner deployed. The problem is the feeeeemales and nothing else.

Apparently, it's traumatic for a woman for her husband to serve overseas in the military (where he is risking his life), and it's so traumatic that it excuses cheating on him. I was appalled and don't understand this for various reasons:

1) This guy is risking his life and she gets to stay safe and sound, how is what she is going through traumatic? It sucks that he isn't around, but he is dealing with the same issue while also having a grueling work schedule and literally risking his life.

2) Feminists rightfully condemn incels for expecting they deserve love, deserve a woman, deserve sex. But many feminists go beyond that, they say that love is not that important. They say that if your biggest problem in life is that you can't get a date, things aren't that bad.

Meanwhile, a woman who is in a relationship is ""traumatized"" because she can't see her boyfriend for a year.

At first, I thought teaching men not to rape was ridiculous. OBVIOUSLY, no guy is going to jump a woman and force her to have sex with her. And teaching a shitty person to not do that won't change anything.

But I've come to realize, not all rape starts with evil intent. A guy misreads a girl, while their naked together, and starts having sex with her, either without permission or after what didn't seem to be a hard enough ""no"".

We have this profile of a rapist. Scruffy, hard guy, been in jail a couple times. But a rapist cannot even know they're raping someone.

15,What does a Radical Feminist restructuring look like?,"I, admittedly, don't know much about the various branches of feminism. I have done a cursory search on this sub and read Wikipedia, among other various reading, but I would love to hear of better resources to increase my understanding.

I think I would consider myself a liberal feminist rather than a radical. The way it was explained to me is that a liberal feminist wants everyone to have equal rights under the law and in society, as well as fair and equal access to jobs, property, etc. Whereas a radical feminist wants to tear down the whole system (or at least major aspects of it) and start fresh. Please correct me if this is incorrect.

Forgive the cooking metaphor, but I think the exact example was; liberals want everyone to have a fair share at the pie, while radicals want to throw out the pie and make an entirely new one.

My question is this: What does such an effort look like? What does a *successful* effort look like? 

The example given to me was with regards to business. Rather than ensuring women have equal encouragement and opportunity to compete in the workplace, society should dismantle current corporate structures and build new ones that value ""feminine"" traits, such as cooperation, over ""masculine"" traits, such as competition.

So, again, is this an accurate representation of the radical feminist's goal? If so, how would such a goal be realized? Do we need to simultaneously tear apart all corporations (and, I guess, all patriarchical organizations) and force a new dynamic? How do we know what the new system should look like? 

I may be attacking strawmen here, but I just can't see how the radical goals are to be accomplished without some sort of tyrannical intervention. Furthermore, how do you decide on what the new system should look like?

It seems like the liberal feminist approach is more reasonable. To take one example, if you increase gender parity in business, one would then be able to more thoughtfully implement changes in the system. In particular, one could then set up a company (or change an existing one) to work in a way that is more in line with gender equality and 'feminine' traits and then see how it works in practice. 

Does anyone know if these sort of experiments have been tried?

I do believe there is wage gap between genders - you can't doubt numbers. But from my current understanding, that even if we control for things such as working hours and same profession - there is a gap. I have heard the gap is due to women not negotiating for wages unlike men. Now here is the thing I don't understand. How is that anyone's fault? If you don't ask for it and bargain, you won't get it?!

As unfair as it sounds, I think if a PERSON manages to negotiate a higher wage, they have earnt it.

Side note, I saw an article on the BBC and it did report that women made less, but the way they calculated this stat was terrible. They didn't factor in jobs, they just went to a company and compared wages between men and women.

25,"Why shouldn't men (or actually women people too) feel entitled to relationships/sex, to some extent?","Okay, so I'm obviously going to have to clarify a lot of things with regards to this question, since it is admittedly quite loaded. First of all, everything in this post assumes heterosexuality and looks at just men and women, which I realize isn't accurate (this is being written by a pansexual AMAB currently-identifies-as-cis-male-but-is-questioning-and-is-possibly-a-trans-enby person for reference), but I'm just doing it to simplify things. 

Clarification 2, I don't think there is any kind of a valid argument that someone should ever, ever feel entitled to sex or romance from one specific person. I believe the way in which men treat women over this is absolutely horrendous and unjustifiable. I don't think anyone should ever be harassed over rejection and the fact that it's commonplace is sad. This is about people who feel entitled to these things from society at large, people who feel cheated by society when they don't have romantic or sexual encounters. 

Clarification 3, I also don't think there's ever a justifiable argument that men should blame women specifically for not being able to get laid. The onus of the problem lies on both the men themselves, and society at large, but not women. 

The main thing that got me thinking about this, though, is the fact that most people experience relationships/sex. [According to this study](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr036.pdf) (go to page 18) by their late 30s, only 1.3% of men have not experienced sexual contact at some point in their lives. [When you consider the fact that about 1% of society is asexual and thus does not want to have sex](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/10/14/asexual.study/) (this was just found from a quick Google Search, could be wrong), the number of people who want to have sex but haven't by that age seems astronomically small. Like, basically statistical anomaly levels. 

It is a very common and basic feminist argument that men feel entitled to sex because media feeds them the message that they deserve it, that it's a prize to be won. This can be seen from sexist tropes that present women as something a hero gets at the end of a quest in a video game, to high school movies where the nerd gets the hot girl at the end. I don't disagree with any of these arguments. But I just have to wonder, even if men weren't fed these tropes throughout their adolescences, maybe they'd still feel entitled to relationships/sex, just because it's something that most people (statistically) seem to experience? And even disregarding these statistics, and not even thinking about this issue in terms of statistics, just look at it in terms of how we as society view these things. Once people enter into their 30s or 40s, their lives are expected to revolve more around their family or marriage. I can't tell you how many people in their late 30s on the internet I've seen talk about how they just don't have time to hang out with their friends anymore because they're all busy with their families or careers. Once we get to a certain age, a large part of our social lives are expected to revolve around our partner and our relationship with them. 

Like, to me it seems kind of logical to feel entitled to something that like 99% of society experiences, and that we make our later adult social lives revolve around. I've seen a couple feminists make statements along the lines of ""Mediocre men should not feel entitled to sex just for being themselves"". But here's the thing: looking at these statistics, the ""mediocre"" men do get laid. The only men who don't are the guys who are way, way below mediocrity. There are basically two options for these men; admit that they're just that undesirable and it's their fault (admittedly a large portion of them should probably do this, but it's just damn *depressing* to admit that you are a less desirable than most other people), or blame society for your romantic failings. And honestly, society probably DOES play a part, it's just not ""the women being selfish whores,"" or whatever the hell incels think. It's everything from patriarchy to ableism (a lot of men who seem entitled to these things seem to have some kind of a social disability) to fatphobia to other axises of oppression. 

The flaw in this logic, though, is that hypothetically women should also feel entitled to these things but for them it's less common. I mean it's definitely a thing too (see r/nicegirls or some of the women who post on r/foreveralone, though the latter to a lesser extent since the majority of them don't really seem ""entitled"" per se). I don't know why this is, and the only explanations I've seen offered to this (other than that women don't feel entitled to this because they're not raised from birth to expect sex/relationships in their media, and I've already explained why I don't think that's necessarily the only reason men feel entitled to these things) is incel-esque bullshit that women gravitate toward chads who receive attention from many women, which is obviously bullshit. So yeah, I don't know how to reconcile that. 

I'm sorry if that was kind of long and all over the place but hopefully I got my main question across (I think the tl;dr is the title + because of the statistics about sexual interactions and how important romantic interactions are considered for all adults, socially). 

Edit: Doh, ""women people,"" should just be ""women"". Title originally said ""women and enby people"" but then while writing I just decided to look at people who fall within the gender binary, so I took out ""and enby"" but forgot to delete ""people"".

26,Someone who is new to feminism and some basic questions,"I took a read of the huge FAQ doc over at r/Feminism and I came across a word many times - essentialism. I understand it as the presentation of the view that females and males are inherently different, and hence is the reason for the huge gender gap across the many fields. This form of thinking, I think, is the main reason why feminism isn't as widely understood as it is; wherein the answer to that problem is that essentialism is bloated out of proportion by nonfeminists and that we are more equal than both genders perceive ourselves to be. 

What examples are there to substantiate this?

30,Do we need a defined male cultural identity that allows and enables men to reject the patriarchal and toxic masculinity?,"It occurs to me that feminism is a movement born by those who have been victimized by a patriarchal culture and toxic masculinity. It's people reclaiming a world that they've been historically and systemically denied.

However, it feels like it's placing the responsibility of change on the victims when in reality, it's men who need to change. It's men who need to take ownership of rejecting this culture that they've perpetuated by their privilege.

The debate of wether or not men can call themselves ""feminists"", I think has largely inhibited men from feeling like they can belong to a movement of the solution rather than feeling like they are a part of a problem that they feel helpless to solve.

I value feminism as a movement that encompasses concepts, ""new"" language and solutions to gender inequality. It's empowered those who have been oppressed.

However, I think there's a missing piece. 

I don't know if it means deciding once and for all that men can label themselves feminists or if men need to recognise the problems and culture that we have that we need to change in ourselves and stand on their own feet and make a complementary movement to feminism. 

This one, I've been mulling about for a while. (And I should note that I think ""/r/MensLib"" explores but I'm not totally supportive of yet).

32,Why is radical feminism considered transphobic?,"Hey!

I never understood why radical feminism is considered transphobic. I can see how trans people can be offended by them at first, but afaik they do not promote transphobia or say that you have to accept the gender role you're ""born"" into, they just say that our gender is defined and built into us fundamentally by the way our culture understands our biology.

I also don't get why some feminists are criticised for excluding trans women from their movement and places like women's bathrooms. Again, it might seem transphobic at first, but it makes sense once you considered how unsafe many women could feel if they had to share these spaces with people who, like it or not, were socialized as men.

53,"If the sexes are truly equal, does that mean that feminists believe genetics plays no role in preferences?","After reading a few of the previous threads where people asked the question “do feminists believe in equality of outcome or equality of opportunity?” and the prevailing answer seemed to be that given all of the same opportunity and devoid of social expectations, equality of outcome would be achieved. This got me thinking; if that is the case, does that mean that feminists believe all of the current preferential differences between men and women are based on society/culture, and none of it on genetics?


I’ve read about the studies that show that primates show preference in toys that they play with (male rhesus monkeys preferred wheeled toys, but female’s played equally with dolls and wheels toys ( Yerkes, 2008)). How would a feminist explain that? Would you say that’s not applicable to humans, or have I misunderstood the opportunity = outcome statement? Do I have flawed logic and perhaps have applied my logic too literally? Perhaps feminists don’t literally believe that men and women are 100% the same in every regard, but we should strive to create as equal of an outcome as possible regardless? 

I guess that is my current understanding, please correct me if I’m wrong.

54,Where do feminists draw the line with drunk sex being rape?,"There's a lot of gray area on this topic IMO. For example, I'm (a woman) in a long term relationship (with a man). There have been nights where I had a few drinks and him none, and we had sex. There's been nights where I had a lot to drink and him little to none, and we had sex. Always on my request, and I've never felt violated. Would you say that is rape? Or at least a situation with a high potential for rape?

Does it matter how familiar the pair are? What about how eager/enthusiastic the drunk is? What if both are drunk? How drunk is too drunk? Can a sober chick rape a drunk man? Does it just depend on how the potential victim feels the day after? Usually when I hear something on this topic it's 'any amount of alcohol makes it rape'. Paradoxically I've also heard 'being drunk is not an excuse for raping a drunk person', which makes me wonder who rapes who in that case. 

My personal feelings are that if the drunk expresses that they don't want sex, it is rape (same as if they were sober), or if they are too drunk to express consent or lack thereof. I don't think we should take a schrodinger's cat approach, where it is not knowable if it was rape until the potential victim sobers up.

56,Why don't women hold each other to a high standard when it comes to their treatment of boys/men?,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been meaning to write about the experiences I’m about to describe for a long time to resolve the anger I still feel for having experienced them (and I have experienced horrible things that should arguably make me feel angrier, but this really takes the cake). I will try my best to present them as objectively as possible, but, as I mentioned it has happened to me and I’m still angry about them, so please be generous and not take it as a personal attack against something you might care about dearly.

So, the experiences I wanted to talk about are a few run-ins with self-proclaimed feminist teachers I have had as a schoolboy, and my feelings surrounding them. I will then ask you a couple questions for you to answer as feminists.

1. My first experience of being discriminated against as a boy at the hands of our homeroom teacher happened in Europe, in elementary school, starting in first grade. Namely, it was an inter-generational collective punishment of boys. I know, it sounds nonsensical, so let me illustrate. The school had two locker/changing rooms, one for girls, and one for boys. However, the boys’ locker room was tiny, smaller than a standard size room, similar in size to a large janitorial room. Girls enjoyed a full-sized room. Being curious about why we had such a disproportionately small room, we were told by the teacher herself, that there is a bigger room that boys used, but she closed it off because ‘we’ (that is boys in general) couldn’t appreciate it. What the boys before us did was write on the walls, other than that, it was still a fully functional locker room. She seemed to take a weird kind of pleasure while telling us that. Then, since the room was used by 30 boys at a time, it was extremely crowded, and one boy in my class almost lost his eye when he was accidentally pushed into some type of protruding decor element, that cut across his forehead, requiring stitches. Even after that nothing changed.

2. Another experience was in junior high, this time in the US, when all boys were prohibited from using the bathroom until one of us came forward and told the teachers which boy had scribbled his name in the bathroom. This seemed so unfair and humiliating to me that, in another female teacher’s English class, when we were allowed to write an essay about any topic we wished, I wrote about how I felt this was unfair and sexist. Despite the fact that I got an A+ on the previous paper and was praised in front of the class, I received a C- on this one, and the criticism of my writing was that this punishment wasn’t in fact sexist. I then complained to my homeroom (also female) teacher about this whole deal, and told her that this was discriminatory, she sneered and said “Boys can’t be discriminated against”, to which I simply replied “Yes, we can be”, then the homeroom teacher asked another female teacher (an older French lady) if such a thing is possible, to which (thankfully) the French teacher replied “Oh yes, absolutely”. This, however, didn’t result in the policy being lifted, let alone an apology. We were only allowed to use the bathroom after a week, when someone admitted that they had done it. The most infuriating thing about this whole thing was that all 7th grade teachers were in on it, and none opposed it.

3. This was in high school, also in the US. We had an AP Psychology teacher who was such a feminist that she surrounded the whole classroom in portraits of great women (whatever). One day we had a lesson about suicides, and the book mentioned that men commit suicide much more often than women, while women have a lot of attempts. It was immediately obvious that the teacher was afraid of this going against her self-pitying narrative, so she asked us if we knew why that was. Nobody raised their hand, until the lone suicidal me raised his hand, and said that it was because of the different methods they use. Upon hearing that, she agreed and looked very triumphal and quickly moved on to other topics. The whole class (boys and girls) looked on the floor in awkwardness because we all knew that her only goal was to confirm her narrative of women having it worse in every way.

There were of course many other instances of what today would be called microaggressions against boys, but these three examples should be enough to demonstrate what I am trying to get at.

Why it matters:
Given that many boys don't have fathers or have fathers who don't give a shit about them, I think that such treatment can leave mental scars. This is especially true due to the fact that the same women protest any and all intentional/unintentional sexism against girls, and the fact that boys have to spend majority of the first 18 years in such an environment.

 So, having read that, please answer the following questions:

-Why do you think that none of the other female teachers protested such blatant discrimination?

-What steps can we take to make sure that such discriminatory abuse of power stop?

-Is feminism at all responsible for creating such an environment?

-Any other thoughts

61,Was this sexist or am I overthinking it?,"So this happened to a friend of mine a couple years ago. He was a normal kid who played football in high school so fairly strong looking.

He went to a shopping mall with his little sister who was about two years old, and their mother. His mother left him with his sister, while she went to some other part of the mall. He was holding her hand while looking around the store, just minding his own business.

Then a woman who works for the store started getting suspicious and she came up to him and asked him whose child is that? He told her it was his little sister. The woman leaves, he thinks that was a little strange, then the next thing he knows mall security is coming into the store and come right at him.

They start asking questions. All the while the kid starts crying, which doesn't help his case. He tells them that he hasn't done anything wrong and he would like to leave now, but they don't let him leave and tell him they'll call the cops if he tries to leave with the girl.

Finally after nearly an hour they find his mother and she's able to explain everything away.

When I first heard this, I asked my other male friends and was surprised to hear that they basically avoid even waving to little kids or even looking at them in public. while my woman friends have told me nothing like this ever happened to them, even when they were babysitting their nephews or neices.

To me (and I'm not an expert in sexism or sociology or anything) it looks like blatant sexism. They saw a big guy with a little girl and just assumed he kidnapped her.

But I've also heard the argument that it's not sexist since men are more likely to be involved in kidnappings, so you err on the side of caution when it comes to seeing potential kidnappings.

so maybe I'm wrong and it wasn't such a big deal, but what do you think?

63,Question for feminists from an MRA.,"First off, let's stay civil. That's the most important thing. I believe, in a free society, discussing ideas is how we figure things out and improve our world.

My question is a simple one. Is it possible that men do so bad in relation to socioeconomic statistics that they wouldn't be seen as a privileged class anymore? If so, what would that look like? 

I ask, because there are a lot of statistics that put men at the absolute bottom of society. I think saying, the people on top who have power are mostly men. Therefor, men have all the power, is an apex fallacy because that is a tiny percentage of men as a whole. They also dominate in almost every negative socioeconomic measure there is. They are now the minority in university by 20%. The vast majority of the homeless. Get harsher sentences for the same crimes. Etc... 

How bad will it have to get for men before we don't say they are privileged anymore? Is there a statistical threshold where we will all say, if men cross over X number, we can say they are enough longer privileged? Or, does it have more to do with history and nothing will change it? Which, I would debate men have historically held all the power as well. But, I think that's a different topic altogether and doesn't really relate to the question at hand.

If you are curious why I consider myself an mra. Is because I went through the family courts for divorce and saw the bias first hand. My ex, who was arrested and found guilty of DV twice while we were married was given custody over me. Which, I have a degree in microbiology, six years as a combat medic paratrooper with an honorable discharge, no criminal record to speak of. Most I've ever got was a speeding ticket. Oh, and my ex refused to take a drug test after I informed the judge that she had an addiction to Xanax. The judge drug tested me instead and claimed I was projecting. I passed it. It was like they wanted to find any reason they could to take my kid away, and looked for any redeeming quality in my ex so she would win custody. She did. Then, six months later, almost killed our daughter in a drunk driving accident where she also took a bunch of Xanax, fell asleep, and crashed into a ditch at 4am, after a night of partying at her friend's house. She had our kid up until 4am, then tried to drive an hour home after about 8 drinks, and some Xanax. Well, that's what the police report said when they did a blood screening for drugs and alcohol. I filed a motion to take custody of our daughter as she was obviously in danger. My motion was denied. Then, about another six months later, she got into another drunk driving accident. So, I filed another motion and got custody. The judge said, and I quote, we are going to watch you like a hawk, and if you make the slightest mistake she will go back to her mother. So, I can't get so much as a blemish on my record, even if it has nothing to do with my kid. Yet, she can drive drunk and on drugs, almost kill our daughter, keep her up at the age of 4 until 4-5am and they still didn't want to switch custody. This doesn't even get into the fact I was a stay at home dad because I had just got out of the army and was going to night classes. I was the one who came running in the middle of the night. Oh, before I forget. One of the main reasons they didn't want me to have custody is because I was deployed twice as a combat medic paratrooper. She said, and the court ate it up, that I shouldn't be trusted because I will probably have ptsd issues and abuse our daughter. Contrary to the fact of their being zero evidence to support the claim, and six witnesses, all mutual friends of both of us, saying the exact opposite. The only witness who would speak on my ex wife's behalf was her own mother. All of the mutual friends from when we were married backed me up as they knew how violent and irresponsible she was.

Sorry to rant. I'm not here to talk about that in the comments. It was to give background on why I follow the men's rights movement. Being a vet, I've seen too many of my good friends kill themselves from lack of proper care when they come home. I've seen the family courts and it made me sick, literally threw up a couple times because of the stress. Also, again, being a veteran, I see too many of them homeless begging for change when they have plenty of specialized training to work a decent job with a liveable wage. 

I absolutely believe in equality. I'm a very progressive individual living in one of the most progressive places in the world, WA state, and at that, probably the most progressive city. I just think men need some help as things are getting really, really bad on a couple fronts for them. Suicide, education, the prison system, and family courts. All are very important issues to me. I just don't agree with feminists on the remedy for these issues.

84,Breastfeeding antifeminist??,"There has been a big push for women to breastfeed instead of formula feed, because it is presumably better for the child. I didn’t think anything of this until I had my first son 17 months ago and now i also have a 7 week old, and some close friends and cousins recently have given birth too.

They don’t tell you that breastfeeding has numerous challenges, and what I have found is that those challenges work against women maintaining their position in the work place and work again equality in childrearing amongst couples. and from that conclusion ive come to actually be against breastfeeding. 

first keep in mind that formula is very good and as close to breastmilk as its ever been. im smart and i was a bf baby. my cousins were - the MD single mother and the Nasa scientist...and we were raised on crappy early 80s formula.

anyway so for example bf (breastfed) babies eat more frequently. say, every hour versus every 2-3 on formula. so, BF moms spend a lot more time breastfeeding than FF (formula fed/feeding) moms do. Because FF babies can eat more in a sitting and tend to stay fuller longer, they tend to sleep better. I have a 7 week old FF baby who sleeps through the night and my friends BF 7- and 11- month olds are still waling seceral times a night to feed. there are a lot of ohysical issues with feeding - engorgement, mastisis, things that can be physically uncomfortable and distracting. you cant go too long without emptying your milk so if you workyou need to pump, which can be uncomfortable and very time consuming. many BF babies also have a tendency to become biased toward actual nipples over bottle nipples - to the point where i know multiple women who spend their first year doing 100% of the feeding because their baby simply wont take pumped milk from a bottle by their husband at home. 

and to too it off when women i know have trouble with the baby latching or mill production and cant BF i see them be totally wracked with guilt - and what i find with most women now is that they BF bc they feed they should. and if they “want to” its bc they “should” bc its “best” but all things considered - is it?

I have watched women who were otherwise motivated hard working women spend their first year of motherhood stressed and sleep deprived, needlessy careying more of the load at home, and worried about going back to work, sottin thru long meetings or travelling for work etc - all on account of BF and the stuff i said above. its too bad bc yes science ahows the benefits of BF but i feel like its pushed on women without regard to that bigger picture. 

i gave up BF with my first after 2.5 weeks. i wanted to do it bc i was told it was best. but i had an 11 pound baby and a herniated disk and couldnt handle it. motherhood went from overwhelming to enjoyable when i stopped breastfeeding. my kid slept thru the night much of the time. my return to work after 12 weeks was stress free and smooth. my husband and i share relatively equally in things. i just fear that the harder BF is pushed on women, that it works against career minded women becoming mothers but staying on track in their careers to the extent they would have had they not had kids.

85,"The ""masculinity vaccuum"" - sort of struggling with this one","I asked a really similar question when I first arrived at this sub, and the answers I got didn't fully bring me to an understanding, so I'm putting this a little differently this time.

We have this concept of ""toxic masculinity"", which I don't dispute. Then we have the people (just about every week here) who claim that feminists vilify men by calling masculinity toxic. The standard accepted response is that ""toxic masculinity"" doesn't label masculinity itself as toxic, but only a version of masculinity that is exaggerated to an unhealthy degree, or certain portions of what is seen as masculine that are extremely destructive. All of this seems reasonable and logical at this point.

Where I run into trouble is all of the ""masculinity"" that we're left with after we remove the toxic stuff; basically, if we look at what we could call ""healthy"" masculine traits, it seems that feminists, once we're there, immediately point out that none of these positive traits are actually masculine. And I'm inclined to agree - courage, bravery, steadfastness, endurance, strength, are all seen as much in women as they are in men.

What we're left with, then, is a situation in which only those things that can be called ""toxic masculinity"" are in fact masculine. In short, the end result is to say that if it isn't toxic, it isn't ""masculine"". And then we're right back where the detractors started. Essentially, we can't claim that toxic masculinity does not refer to all masculinity unless we're able to point to a kind of genuine masculinity that isn't toxic, *and can legitimately be called masculinity*.

The only way I've found to make sense of this, and I've hinted at this in previous comments, is that the traits themselves (bravery, a healthy dose of stoicism, strength, assertiveness) are not inherently masculine, but may take more masculine or feminine expressions, i.e. they may look a little different on men than on women. Just as importantly, traits seen as feminine, like compassion, nurturing, emotional expression, are not actually inherently feminine, but may take a masculine or feminine expression. At the same time, it's important to note that a woman expressing one of those traits in a traditionally masculine way is no less a woman, and vice versa.

Can anyone throw some light on this one for me? It seems that unless we're willing to point to something that we can call both healthy and legitimately masculine, it's tough to claim that ""toxic masculinity"" doesn't actually refer to everything that we're willing to recognize as masculine.",AskFeminists,1525150421,Stavrogin78,105,28,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8g5xpu/the_masculinity_vaccuum_sort_of_struggling_with/,2018-05-01

107,Serious: When is it ok for a man to hit a woman?,"Please read before downvoting!!!
I'm a 38 year old very progressive white male and I've always seen myself as a feminist/male ally, but experienced something today that honestly has me confused about something. Please hear me out...

So I'm downtown standing at a busy intersection waiting to cross when a group of women and a small child who weren't paying attention walk into traffic and almost get hit. When the car honks at them, one woman throws a tantrum- yelling at the driver, aggressively gesticulating, and refusing to leave the road. She continues to taunt the driver as she goes on her way, but then accidentally hits me while she's waving her arms. I voiced my displeasure, and told her to ""watch where she was going"", and she started getting physical with me. Her friends surrounded me and started yelling at me, and I just stood there, stonefaced, waiting to cross the street. Then she pushed me and spat a giant loogie on my face from point blank range. I calmly retreated, and they stood there taunting me. Although it was mild, this is a textbook case of assault. I am grossed out and seriously worried about what germs could have been transmitted during this interaction. No human should get away with this, but she did because my conservative upbringing has taught me to ""never hit a woman."" (Which I generally understand to include physically overpowering women as well). This all happened on a busy intersection with plenty of witnesses who just looked on.  If it makes a difference, I am a white man, and the women were young 20 something black women. 

I subscribe to the general view that people shouldn't hit people, but I also know that my assailants sex/gender affected my decision making.  If it was a guy who did the same thing (depending on his size of course) I wouldn't have tucked my tail and ran.  

I'd appreciate the view of the feminist reddit community from two perspectives...the practical ""what should I have done?"" and the philosophical...""does equal rights always come with equal responsibilities?,"" and ""with what degree of force is it ok for a man to get physical with a woman?

135,A feminist approach to de-radicalizing incels,"This isn't really a question, so I'm not sure if it's appropriate here. It's more putting forth a topic for discussion.

Anyways, I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/7z1a2d/feminists_more_stuff_like_this_please_not_kidding/?st=jguc8ryd&amp;sh=c1de7985) in r/Braincels, and it's kind of puzzling because it's presented as ""I like *this* type of feminism"" when in fact this image represents the mainstream of feminist thought, i.e. the critique of toxic masculinity.

I've often thought there is a lot that feminism can offer these people, not just the critique of the toxic masculinity but also of looksism and body-shaming, but there's a gap in understanding engendered by the sort of red pill/manosphere ideology that incels are a part of, which strawmans Feminists, and in the thread you can see redpillers pushing back against the ideas while exemplifying the same sort of toxic masculinity it critiques.

On the one hand, I can see why feminists are loathe to be the ones to bridge this gap since a lot of these folks have become so inundated with this ideology that they are misogynist in the most literal sense of the word. And it's wrong to put the onus on women to educate people who hate them.

On the other hand, there might be people who are not too far gone to be helped by these critiques—provided the messaging is on point— and they're certainly not going to take the initiative to seek out other narratives. And without generalizing too much, it's not uncommon to see some women lashing out at incels and engaging in virgin-shaming or body-shaming. (Just to be clear I'm not blaming women for incels' attitudes here. I just think sometimes people rage out on the internet and they say mean things that not only reinforce toxic masculinity but also further radicalize incels who are primed to see feminists and women as a monolith to begin with.)

So what are your thoughts? What are some ways we can better package these ideas so that they are more palatable to people who could obviously benefit from them?

141,Marketing to women and problematic representations,"So my wife and I were sitting around the fire last night and got talking about the representations of women in some kinds of advertising, particularly ads that are marketing traditionally masculine things to women - like, for instance, hunting gear and apparel. I brought up an example we'd recently seen in an outdoors-type magazine - a near full-page photo of a woman decked out in camo, with all the stuff she'd need to go bag a moose or something, rifle slung over her back. The ad immediately annoyed me, because the woman herself looked basically airbrushed, like she had perfect makeup, pink lipstick, even sparkly earrings.

I realized I was reacting for sort of two reasons: first, it looked to me like the advertisers were playing to stereotypes of femininity, sort of saying ""See, you can go hunt a moose and still look pretty, too!"" as though it was just assumed that looking ""feminine"" and pretty while hunting was something that would be important to female hunters. Second, I realized that those details immediately made me take the person in the photo *less seriously* as a hunter. This is where we get into maybe problematic territory. On the one hand, it's possible that seeing traditionally feminine things (makeup, jewelry) is making me take someone less seriously. But at the same time, I'd like to think that my reaction here is more due to the fact that not only are those details non-functional in a hunting situation, but may actually be ""anti-functional"". Because I don't have the same reaction to a woman with makeup and shiny earrings in a different context (like, say, a lawyer or accountant or researcher). Other times when I've seen female hunters depicted without those things, I haven't had that same reaction, so I have to think that it's not about the person being female, but the particular presentation.

So, I guess, two questions here: First, what do you folks think of the advertising itself? Do you have a similar annoyance when you see women depicted with a sort of ""You can be pretty and shiny *and* do (some rough or dirty, traditionally masculine thing)!"" as if the pretty-and-shiny bit is really that important? Or do you have a totally different take? And second, does the presence or absence of these traditionally feminine indicators ever affect how seriously you take someone in certain contexts?

Totally willing to accept that there could be some lingering sexist attitudes on my part, here, but curious what all of you think.

144,Clarification on the subject of alcohol and consent.,"Hi there, 

Based on searching this forum I understand as a general rule, that consent cannot be given if a person is sufficiently intoxicated, roughly to the point where one couldn't make a conscious choice anymore due to the level of alcohol consumed. 

I would like clarification on this one scenario (I have searched this forum, but there are so many posts concerning this topic, it's all a bit confusing). 

A man and a woman have sex after a night out, they are both intoxicated to similar levels, but not to the point of passing out/unconsciousness, nor to the point where they can't form reasonably coherent sentences. But they are drunk enough where either one or both parties are about to engage in sex that they otherwise wouldn't have if they were sober. They both consent verbally and physically and give no indication throughout that they want it to stop (but this is still heavily influenced by the alcohol). 

In this situation, can any of the two parties claim that a rape has taken place, or some form of sexual assault against them, by the other person (for any reason, such as regret), due to the intoxication? My understanding is that if one party was intoxicated but the other was not, then this could be considered rape, otherwise (assuming consent has been given) it cannot.

I feel the problem lies within popular culture. Men seem to be told that if they show emotions, they are weak.

And I don’t think anyone would argue that someone also can’t give consent if they’re being threatened with violence if they say no

Here’s my conundrum

A couple I knew once had some issues, the woman in the relationship was a drinker and one night she got very drunk (not to the point of passing out but definitely beyond being able to consent) and demanded her boyfriend had sex with her.

When he told her he didn’t want to because she was drunk and he didn’t want to feel like he was taking advantage of her, she beat him over the head and bit his arm so hard she drew blood and he now has a permanent scar from it...

About a week later she got drunk again and once again demanded sex, adding that if he didn’t agree this time she’d get violent again so he agreed to it just to avoid another outburst

I’m curious who people would think is in the wrong in this situation as he (completely sober) did have sex with a drunk person which would imply he raped her

29,"How is the ""pink tax"" anything more than companies reacting to market forces?","I've heard a lot of about the ""pink tax"", the idea that women are charged more than men for identical products, usually toiletries and things like that. I've seen lots of posts about it on r/TwoXChromosomes , articles written about it in mainstream publications, and I was even made to watch a 20 minute video about it in a college English Class.

Despite the issue getting so much attention, I'm still confused as to why people believe it to be a problem.

Prices are determined by market forces, the amount of money people are generally willing to spend on a good or service. This suggests that if certain products marketed toward women cost more, it's because women are generally willing to spend more on those products.

I don't see the sexism in that. Are women not free to simply seek the lowest priced item, regardless of which gender it's marketed toward? Are women not free to refuse to pay the ""pink tax""? And if enough women did refuse to pay it, wouldn't the market forces shift, forcing companies to start offering products marketed toward women for lower prices in order to remain competitive?

My point is that I think the ""pink tax"" is a bit of a misnomer since it's not compulsory. Is there something I'm missing here? I'm hoping someone can help shed some light on the subject.

30,Gendered spaces,"There are several spaces that, especially for young people, are segregated for male and female users - changing spaces/locker rooms for gyms/swimming pools/sports centers, etc (at schools and or similar facilities).

There is a request from several transgender activists/groups that transgender women be allowed in such women's spaces.

My questions are:

1. Is it possible to implement this in any reasonable manner? Who else besides transgender women would be allowed (as in - what happens to gender fluid, third gender, agender persons? Do they get to decide their preferred space, and change their mind as they see fit)?

2. If we allow (pre-op) transgender girls/women in women's spaces, is there still any justification for not allowing boys/men as well?

3. Pragmatically speaking, how soon could such policies of allowing transgender women in women's spaces be implemented (say, in your country, nation-wide)?

32,"Having trouble determining if my stance is feminist, misogynist, or somewhere else entirely. Want to manage any uninformed harmful views, but avoid following things beliefs just because they are popular. Can anyone help clarify some questions?","Hi. So, recently I have been googling a lot about certain feminist issues, from the pay gap to sexual harassment and more. After a while I feel more disorientated than I was at the beginning. I agree with some views and others I don't feel convinced about. I worry that I can just be labeled a misogynist for some views fairly, or that maybe it will be unfairly. So i will run through my views in some areas and I was hoping people could clarify am I a part of the problem so to speak. 

I feel pushing gender roles onto anyone is only going to hurt, if a girl wants to climb trees and make a treehouse awesome, if a boy wants to wear a dress it would be great to live in a society where we didnt think twice about that. 

I think it is awesome to show more girls in children's tv and to have more women in movies. I want to see women in roles from the good to the bad to the ugly: the heroes, the villains, the comedy sidekicks, the nerds, the greedy, the immoral, the altruistic etc, etc. I think this encourages a mentality that you can do anyone, and stops women being seen as ""women"" rather than people. 

I feel too much in our society we have a woman as the other. Canada changed it's anthem to be more gender neutral and that's great. I think little things like the word mankind and the female icon on a bathroom being a head, legs, arms, and a dress aren't the worst things in the world but are signs of underlying views as to how we compartmentalise the sexes (never understood why the male and female icons were the picture chosen to represent this sub). 

Rape is inevitably tough and a hard thing to convict but we can work to have a society that is more open about it and makes the process as comfortable as possible for the accuser. 

I'm pro-choice. Think classes in school about consent would be great. The metoo movement's goal towards a more open conversation about sexual harassment, especially in the workplace, is extremely important. Sexual objectification is too much in media.

However, with all of that comes some other views. The pay gap (i know sorry XD) is something i struggle with. 

From my ""research"" it seems really inaccurate to say women make 79c for every dollar a man makes for the same work. I've seen motherhood is a big penalty here, and possibly the good daughter penalty too. But i see so much momentum directed to companies and governments when I'm not sure how this is their fault. There may be societal norms that pressure women, and it would be great to remove them, but that happens with how we raise and treat each other. Also i think giving fathers leave would help as it allows women to go back earlier. There may be a difference with choice and where women go. It doesnt seem crazy to me that two sexes might have difference in career choices based on different intrinsic values. I am totally happy to suggest that there can be social pressure, but i dont rule out the possibility that the sex that can have a baby in their womb for 9 months might feel an instinctive attachment to want to stay home *more* than the other sex and so look for better flexibility with lower pay. Or that women may on more likely prefer jobs that dont always pay as well. I just dont know, but i read an article in the economist that concluded with saying the question should really be ""how big should the pay gap be""...and that seems fair. Again, it could be pressures but it feels like it is not awful to suggest there might be some differences, yet i feel today it is asserted it is definitely pressure. Then there could also be sexism, not hiring women who might get pregnant, or struggles for mothers with biases, or too many men who have biases with women.

It just feels like you have to be on one side of the other.

I'm torn on the dear colleague letter, from what i remember after reading what the 4 Harvard law feminists wrote back when it was controversial as some of their points on fairness made a lot of sense. (source:https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33789434/Fairness%20for%20All%20Students.pdf?sequence=1) it does seem to make sense that it might be unfair...but then i feel like i am simply a rape apologist in the eyes of most fellow young people today.  

I also am not entirely convinced by the pink tax (non-governmental, any tax on things like tampons seems dumb). Simply because i think...well, i'm a guy and I know a hairstylist has to compete more for my business. Heck half the time i might be too lazy so i dont bother getting it cut, or i grab a scissors and cut it myself. It feels like it makes sense to advertise a lower price for men than women when you know you have to compete more, just like it makes sense that students get a lower price. Now if you say well you shouldn't discriminate based on gender period if the products are the same...cool! But then, yeah, i think things like ladies night should not be an exception (also think its bad for women as they are like a commodity but that is a separate story).

I feel a feminist, just like the rest of us, can have a bias. Just like i can be too far to understand something someone can be too close to not have any biases. I know i have some biases that i try to catch (this article was illuminating for me and i had to correct how i had been thinking: http://www.thecrimson.com/column/femme-fatale/article/2017/3/2/hu-let-me-take-selfie/). But sometimes i feel if i disagree then society sees me as a bad person. Like with Emily linden saying she was ok with innocent mens careers taking a bash, i feel like i will be seen as standing in the way but i just dont believe in two wrongs making a right and that seems like a bias based on how hard the struggle has been to help women. I dont hate her at all, shes probably very nice...but i do care about being fair even when it hurts. 

So i dont know...i guess i feel like more and more i am starting to be seen as the problem of society. Any advice on what i could read, or do i need to reexamine myself? this all must sound so selfcentred, i guess cuz it is, but it can be hard to see yourself clearly from the inside.

In my own research, I've been tipped off to the works of Donna Haraway and her cyborg manifesto in particular, which seems to be a bit of a precursor to contemporary transhumanism and gender-crit.

I'm lucky to work in an industry filled with a variety of self-described feminists and academic feminists, but I'm surprised to find out that Haraway's work is relatively unknown in the circles I move in.

44,Is normalizing crossplay good or bad for improving attitudes about genderfluidity and the gender spectrum?,"So, this is a bit of an odd topic for me, and the question is sort of a response to things that have happened today (and are happening right now!), so I probably don’t have a well-formulated thought, but I’ll give it a try.

Some background, as this is a niche topic for some:

So among popular League of Legends streamers, there has very recently become a trend of streamers dressing in professional crossplay (cosplay across traditional gender lines) for their streams generating a *lot* of interest.  It started years ago, when popular top lane streamer (and Riven main) Boxbox dresses up to stream as [Battle Bunny Riven](https://twitter.com/boxboxlol/status/534457351546212352?s=21) as, I think, a donation incentive.  It was met with a mix of skepticism, disturbance, and appreciation for the cosplay, but was generally well-received, and while he’d occasionally bring it back out, only this crossplay would happen, and only through him—it was just sort of *his gimmick*.

Then, last month, C9 Sneaky (a professional LoL player) posted this [Dark Elementalist Lux](https://twitter.com/sneaky/status/973275009866084353?s=21) cosplay, and sort of *destroyed* reddit for the day.  Topped /r/all across multiple subs, generated a *tremendous* amount of discussion on the cosplay (and confusion among casual observers).  Streamed that day in the cosplay, and easily generated tens of thousands of dollars in donations and subscribers that night alone.  The response for the cosplay was overwhelmingly positive, especially toward the quality of work in the costume itself, even if a lot of it was memes.

This positive response has led to Boxbox crossplaying [Star Guardian Soraka](https://twitter.com/boxboxlol/status/983808854822711298?s=21) and Sneaky crossplaying [Pizza Delivery Sivir](https://twitter.com/sneaky/status/984161058775490560?s=21) in consecutive days, the latter of which is being streamed right now.  Both have been met with a high degree of support for the quality of work, but when I was browsing through the Pizza Delivery Sivir stream on the LoL subreddit, I noticed—in addition to the “confused boner” and “are traps gay?” level discussions—comments like “of course you’re all attracted to this, Sneaky’s presenting as a girl here” and “this is what gender expression looks like” and “it’s a fucking spectrum jfc” and “in a limited way, we are catching up to old times/other cultures [on allowance of diverse gender expression]”.  Which weren’t exactly topics of discussion I wasn’t expecting when I happened upon the League sub at all, even if they are being buried among the same memes as last month.

I think that adding to all of this general exposure is the fact that these are two of the most popular streamers on the most popular game streamed on Twitch, routinely drawing around or even over 10,000 concurrent viewers any given stream (Sneaky is streaming to 22,000 viewers now).  They are both very public figures in gaming spheres, who otherwise present as cisgendered men.

My question is: **is this sort of newfound exposure actually good for attitudes about gender fluid expression?**

Asking from a position of literal ignorance on the matter, I can imagine that there are a lot of pros and cons on the matter, but I don’t know what to make of them.  For example: each of these cosplays has a sexual component to them, and it is not immune to all the standard assumptions that plague cosplay in general.  However, this is also true of the way drag queens dress (at least, that’s the impression I’ve gotten from my limited exposure, through seeing RuPaul stuff show up on /r/all and the occasional drag event, which tends to be priced out of my range anyway); however, this doesn’t diminish the art medium for queens, and there’s a degree of artistic expression on display with these crossplayers beyond just being played for laughs.  At the same time, drag queens and cosplayers are swimming in drastically different circles—drag queens seem to operate predominantly in LGBT+ circles which are supportive of the activity, while these crossplayers are operating within gaming communities, which skew very young, very masculine, and sometimes very homophobic—which both means that there are a lot of very traditional assumptions being confronted with this type of cosplay broadcasted to so many people, and that positive reactions might be highly unusual, and steeped in no small amount of irony (and transphobia).  Finally, there are a lot of negative assumptions and stigma about MtF crossplayers, some of which are homophobic, others more of the generic “fat, hairy, smelly Sailor Moon” type.  These particular crossplays from very public-facing streamers challenge these assumptions and generating broader interest—but by entering into a very unfamiliar space that they, as cisgendered men, might not be navigating with full knowledge of where they’re going.

Is this sort of representation helpful of harmful in the long run?  In the short term, even?  For trans* men and women, or for people who are gender fluid?  Does the apparent lack of concern of the streamers for the broader social context make their actions any more or less ethical?  Or does all of this really not matter at all in a broader sense, and it’s just kids doing unusual things for the camera/for money?",AskFeminists,1523523441,rewardadrawer,32,31,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8boqla/is_normalizing_crossplay_good_or_bad_for/,2018-04-12

That being said, those were accomplishments largely championed and won for white, upper-middle class women (for example, black women have always worked in the U.S.). I’ve heard some of the early feminist founders were even racist and indifferent to the equal rights of non-whites.

Feminism (at least in America) seems to be more targeted at issues that are important to upper-class liberal white women. And since not all women  in this country are upper-middle class (or white), feminism falls on deaf ears for a lot of us.

59,Shouldn't they be called reproductive 'privileges' because they only apply to women and men don't have reproductive rights?," Probably the most offensive idea you could propose to a modern feminist is that a woman should be forced to carry and care for a child she doesn't want and can't afford to care for. If you want to add insult you might throw out terms like ""well, I guess you should have thought about that before you decided to have sex without a condom.""

But what are a woman's reproductive 'rights?' If she wants to avoid pregnancy she has a myriad of options that the women's rights movement have assured she can gain access to. Even if she avoids those she can access emergency contraceptives. Feminists have used their influence to make sure that is available and over the counter. Even if she ignores those options she can always get an abortion. Feminists fought hard for that right. But even if she ignores that option, she can put the child up for adoption without the father's consent. She can abandon it at a fire station. Even if she decides to keep a child she can't afford she could place the financial burden on the tax payers and the father who might be even more financially limited than she is. If she really wanted to clean up, she could claim a wealthier guy is the father, have his wages garnished and even if her fraud is discovered there will be almost no chance that she will be charged with a crime, even if this act of fraud costs him more money than a more widely recognized crime might. In fact, she doesn't even have to spend the money on the child. She could buy herself any number of luxuries with her child support payments and no one will ever require her to present any evidence that she isn't abusing the system. 

What reproductive rights do men have? They can't opt out of paying for children they can't afford. Feminists claim to stand for gender equality but would they remain silent if women were being thrown in jail for having kids they couldn't afford? Would they remain silent if women were being forced to pay child support to a man who raped them and was given custody by default (Yes. Women have raped underage boys and successfully sued for child support). Reproductive rights might be the biggest platform of the women's rights movement, but how can they claim to stand for equality when they go so far to ensure that a woman is never burdened with a child she doesn't want or can't afford, but will at best ignore a man in an identical situation or even go so far as to flippantly say, ""well, I guess you should have thought about that before you decided to have sex without a condom.""",AskFeminists,1523593916,Bru2lHonesty,99,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8bwjpm/shouldnt_they_be_called_reproductive_privileges/,2018-04-13

69,Can MRA and feminists collaborate on men's issues in your opinion?,"Okay, being upfront, I'm a MRA. I probably say a lot of things that many here would consider problematic. I don't apologize for my positions or my opinions, though I do try to be tactful IRL. I'm not here to defend my positions, those of the MRM or attack the positions of feminists.

I'm keenly aware that there are differences between the feminist movement at large and the MRM, both small and significant. Some of these differences are probably irreconcilable, at least in the short to medium term. I want to hope a significant portion of our movements (there will always be outliers) can someday bury the hatchet to improve the human condition, since after all we're both in the sinking boat that is called ""life"". I hope you can try to look past my own personal positions and address my question with respect and with the assumption I am making this post in good faith, an attitude I will reciprocate in my comments.

------------------

Now that I've gone through my little preamble, my question is thus: Despite the fundamental differences between our movements, **in your personal opinion**, can we and should we achieve a degree of collaboration on specific men's (and women's) issues?

ie: Educational challenges specific to boys, the judicial gap, the suicide/death gap and so on.

I'm aware this has happened in the past and sometimes happens today, which is why I am requesting your personal view on it. I'm also not asking whether you think a separate men's movement is warranted (though feel free to discuss that topic, or any other one if you want as a separate issue). I'm also aware of the early men/women's lib movement.

If there's a lot of qualifiers to my question it's not meant to bring any offense, it's to try to avoid red herrings and narrow down the scope of my question, which is in essence whether you would be willing to collaborate with a movement you presumably dislike for the greater good (in a limited capacity), even if that movement doesn't change its fundamental assumptions.

70,advice for a dumb cis male,"Hi, as a cis male I was hoping for some advice with regards to something shitty I’ve done  which has been stressing me out a lot.

Last year myself and a girl who lived in another city sparked a long distance friendship through occasionally seeing eachother at concerts. We were pretty close for about 6 months, and in this time, about every 2-3 weeks, we would sext back and forth, consensually as it was not always me who initiated it and i was always sure to make sure she was ok with engaging in it.

This friendship ended when i made a crude comment about sex and she was i guess immediately disgusted and didn’t reply to my messages for days, i realised somethingg was up and apologised profusely over multiple messages in the space of a day, and possibly came off a bit self-centred as I talked more about how worried I was rather than how she felt. My friend then made me aware she had tweeted screenshots of the exchange with my name etc. blocked out. I was incredibly stressed out as well as regretful of what had happened, and sent her a longer, more thought out apology focusing more on how i had made her feel. She read this but didn’t reply.

Fast forward to now and we haven’t interacted at all, but I’m still incredibly paranoid that people are aware it was me in those messages and anytime I’m somewhere we have mutual friends that I’m being talked about and looked at as a gross abuser.

I’m incredibly regretful of my actions and how i made this person feel, and I just wish there were some way to mend things.

103,Another question regarding male/female suicide,"So after seeing so much of the discussion here, it finally occurred to me to ask: if women attempt suicide at roughly the same rate as men, then why do we put the blame for male suicide on ""toxic masculinity""? Presumably, women don't face the same social pressures (repressing emotions, not asking for help) that toxic masculinity places on men. If that were really the culprit, would we not expect to see *higher* suicide attempt rates among men than women?

Let me be clear that I'm in no way disputing the existence of toxic masculinity; I'm well aware it's a real, and harmful, thing. All of this discussion has just got me thinking that *if* it is to blame for the rate of male suicide attempts (note the distinction between the attempt and completion rate here, where the completion rate is much, much higher for men), then female suicidality must have its own distinct causes that aren't being talked about.

All of this said, while the rate of attempts is close to the same, there's no denying that suicidality is far, far more lethal to men, so it makes sense to prioritize them in the research. But do you think the factors contributing to suicidality in men and women are significantly different? If women are (as the discussion regarding toxic masculinity and male suicide sort of leaves us to suppose) more willing to seek out help and talk about their emotions, and yet they attempt suicide as much as men do, are we barking up the wrong tree?

For some reason, I was under the impression that this was illegal.

A while ago, I read on a Men’s Rights forum (I’m more partial to feminism, but I think that they have some points too) that the wage gap in modern times is a result of women on average working in jobs with lower salaries (which would still represent an imbalance, but from a different source), not a result of employers actually paying women less than men, but now I’ve learned that the later is still perfectly legal. Is the formal still the main reason, or does the later also play a role?

I'm already going through a really hard time, and comments like those make me feel worthless and unwanted. They make me feel less than them. I asked a good friend if it would be just as bad if the genders were reversed, and she said it would be worse if it was guys saying that stuff about girls.

112,Does labelling myself a feminist matter as much as the things I believe in?,"So I've been thinking a lot about this over the last year or so. In the past I have called myself a feminist, but have shyed away from the term in the last couple of years for a couple of reasons. For example, I find that a lot of wage gap statistics that I have looked at take broad averages that don't account for the job worked. I do however also acknowledge that there are lots of factors involved in this that aren't entirely separable from gender. I digress.

There are other feminist points and arguements that I am strongly in favour of. Such as the push for more women in STEM and also pushing for the education of women in places and cases where such things are more frowned upon or less common. 

My question kinda comes down to this; well, two questions. The first is if being skeptical of certain parts of feminism or feminist issues makes me ""un-feminist"" or even anti-feminist. The secound being that if the label of feminist is more important than my personal beliefs or actions.

He will argue that he thinks everyone deals with prejudice and that he doesn't feel more privileged than anyone else. He brings up the fact that he grew up in the Appalachian region and is often characterized as a hillbilly based on his accent (which is not really that strong IMO.)

I'm always in disbelief about this tack he takes and his inability to see that someone making a joke every once and a while about his heritage is nothing compared to the systemic oppression of minorities, especially racial minorities in the US. I tell him that he's never had his ability to get a job or pursue opportunities threatened because he's in the majority but he won't budge, saying he has experienced oppression because of his background and that he hasn't been hurt any less than anyone else.

I'll then mention that as a woman I'm in frequent fear for my safety in ways he can't understand (he's got a large frame and is 6'2""!)

135,Coddling vs. Respecting men's feelings,"I've kind of had this question kicking around in my head for a while now, but couldn't quite figure out how to ask it.

[This article](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/greatest-threat-patriarchy-men-getting-touch-with-feelings-pgtn/) came up on /r/Menslib this morning, and something inside me sort of cheered when I read it, because it echoed a lot of what I've been feeling for a long time. (I think maybe there are a couple of problematic things with the way it uses the term ""radical feminism"", but I'm a little unclear on that). But it brought me back to this question.

I've heard before (can't recall where) that girls and women are taught to coddle men's feelings. I confess I don't understand this as a cis male. So I've got two questions: In what way are women taught to do that, and what does it look like? And second, is there a line between respecting someone's feelings and ""coddling"" them?

140,Are men more likely to form clubs of unique hobbies?,"Hi there, this is something I've noticed in my country Singapore, and I am unsure if it's anecdotal, or that it happens elsewhere.

I have seen many clubs over the years, and participated in quite a few. I notice there is a much greater ratio of males to females in the unique hobbies. Examples are:

Bird-keeping

Fossil collection

World of Warcraft

Conspiracy theorist (was only here for 2 meetings)

My Little Pony (much to my surprise)

In all of these clubs, it's 80% or 90% males. The members in this club, as far as I can see, are not rude to women, and leaders have expressed curiosity as well. They confirmed they did not specifically seek out males only. It's also worth noting all these clubs are ""outgoing"" clubs in the sense members often meet in public, especially the bird-keeping club.

The only clubs I've been with a roughly equal ratio are the anime club, church(not a club, but you get my drift) and badminton club, though I guess these are more ""normal"" hobbies? I don't know if I notice the unequal ratio because I am a male, and females have their own clubs with equally skewed ratios; that I haven't been in enough unique hobby clubs to make a good judgement; or that males are simply more likely to form open clubs with unique hobbies; or maybe there's other logical explanations.

141,What am I missing here?,"With regards to the problem of women being discriminated against on the labor market, I have have been pondering something.

Given that the success of a company in a free market is dependent on the productivity of its workers, be it intellectual- or manual labor and therefore the game of trying to be a successful company, in no small part boils down to that company's ability to acquire the most productive workers.

Should it not follow that regardless of whatever underlying distribution that may describe the talent within a certain gender, the company that considers applicants in a gender invariant way has a massive advantage over the one that for whatever reason, has a negative bias towards a given gender. The advantage here being that the probability of coming across talented applicants increases with the size application pool under consideration.

If the above is true it should also follow that over time, any company which implements a hiring process that discriminates against gender will lose out against the one that does not, leaving the only sustainable hiring process the one that does not discriminate against superficial attributes, in this case gender.

2.	Hiring outcomes in proportion to the ratio between men and women in the applicant pool.

Likewise, if 70% of the applicants are women, and 30% men, the company would hire 7 women and 3 men. 

3.	Blind review process, so that a third party would blank out all of the names and genders on the applications, and the people reviewing the applications would only have each applicant’s qualifications to go by, without knowing respective genders.

149,"I wanna talk to you guys, i need to vent some stuff that i have on my mind","Hello i have a few questions for everyone

Sexuality in general has been a bit puzzling for me as of late. Firstly i have to say that i don't really like sexual attraction (i consider myself somewhere on the asexual spectrum kinda a ""grey"" sort of sexuality, i do occasionally feel attraction towards women) as i view it as something that has value only in a very specific number of scenarios. Most of the time it either gets in the way of things or creates problems. Let me explain, i am a man, when i was straight i would get the typical sexual urges; at one point i questioned the usefulness of these feelings ""why is sex good? Why should i follow these feelings? what would be the result?"" the conclusion was, pleasure. Masterbation, sex, they would give pleasure, pleasure is ""good"" just like eating candy or playing video games or shooting up crystal meth. Wait a second, oh yeah, thats not really the case is it? In my mind pleasure without purpose is pretty useless in of itself. What can be said about the usefulness of the heroin high? What does its pleasure bring to the table? in other words, how does it improve my life? The answer is that it obviously doesn't. With its pleasure, comes a vice as well as its many other health issues. It is pleasure that is without substance, it is worthless pleasure. I see casual sex in much of the same way, to find some persons worth as only sexual and to capitalize on that. to use someone only as a sexual ""release"" and then discard that person. It is similar to how the addict uses the needle then discards it after its use. In other words, it is dehumanising (i want to fuck that piece of meat then leave). It also is pleasure without substance, let me explain it like this. Let us compare the pros and cons of casual sex. What does it give me? What are the costs? The sexual engagement gives a couple of pros, it obviously brings pleasure but one could also argue that it also relieves stress as well as a few other reasons. I must admit i can't really think of anything else positive to say when it comes to additional pros, but that is obviously not to say that there are no more out there. Also please keep in mind that this is *my opinion* of casual sex. I am in no way condemning it or shaming anyone that engages in this behavior. I am just presenting how i view casual sex and why i dislike it. Any ways, it's just that, to me such an arrangement brings a lot more cons then it does pros. The risk of sexual assault, STD's, illness all for a few moments of pleasure with someone that may have little to no emotional connection. By being openly promiscuous and sexual one makes the ""adventure"" or the excitement of sex mundane, boring and redundant. As i see it, sex without intimacy brings pleasure without purpose. This is why i think of sex as useful in intimate relationships where sex acts as a binding agent between the consenting intimate parties. Its pleasure is my love made flesh, my acts of passion sement the trust that i have. I give all that i am and you do the same, in this way it becomes more than friendship. We trust each other not only with emotions and our thoughts but with our bodies as well. In this way, it is a complete bond between the consenting parties. My love, my emotion AND my body, all yours, as is mine, together as one. To give sex to a stranger or acquaintance starves it of what meaning i want it to have. I want sex to *mean something* making it a simple act of pleasure deprives it of *my* special meaning. This is one of the very reasons why sexuality is problematic for me. Outside of its use as a intimacy binding agent i find that it is basically useless. I want to form a relationship with someone based on personality and character *then* use sexuality to create the more holistic bond that i was speaking of earlier. In other words, it would make more sense for friendship to be before attraction but that is of course almost never the case. Many people hook up based on looks and wallow in their lust for a couple of months only for them to come to the understanding that they dislike each other on a personal level ( once the lust wears off). ""Beauty"" is something that is finite and superficial, its attraction wears away over time as well. All that remains is the personal connection ( or lack of ) this is what determines a successful relationship IMO.

Any ways now that you understand how i view sexuality i want to talk about the feminist perspective on objectification and why i find it to be slightly problematic. Firstly, i would like to express that what i consider objectification in order to make clear that i actually do understand it as defined under common feminist doctrine ( if there even is such a thing) 

Objectification occurs when an individual is judged and or is thought of (or used) in a way that denies that persons agency as a human being. In other words, it shows a person as a tool to be used, abused and thrown away. I remember when i first came to understand just how screwed women currently are in their situation. I was standing in the middle of a local mall, wandering about, loitering as usual. My eyes moved through a sea of commercial storefront. In each of its windows you had the usale array of commercial shit, stuff we buy that we don't really want or need. It was at that moment it hit me, women are seen as sexual objects so much so that it has become a cornerstone of their identity! (IE its internalized)  Women are seen as sexual creatures first *then* maybe as human beings second. But the princlbe attribute to which women are judged ( regardless of anything else ) is appearance. But wait, aren't men seen in a similar way when it comes to fulling the masculine role? Are men not seen as masculine first then as people second? The thing is that masculinity is seen as a requirement for humanity, in other words, the first thing that is checked ( if you are a man) is your masculinity. If the check is passed you are then evaluated based on other attributes, (intelligence, charisma, personality etc...) and ultimately considered a whole person with many different facets of being. In this way, in order to be man, one must pass ""the test"". For women femininity does not offer a test to pass in order for her to declare person ship. Instead it's fullment *is* the defining characteristic of being women, in other words, when one is women one is seen as it's defining characteristic, a sexual object. Accepting the role and moving forward ( however toxic and damaging) does not open the possibility for any thing else other then its fulment. As a woman you are seen as this and (more of less, in the eyes of greater common culture) nothing else unlike a man. I will admit however that not all women are objectified the same or seen the same. I am not proposing some essientlist claim such as ""to be a woman is to be seen as an object"" as there are women out there that are not seen in such a way and they are most certainly women. It is a reality, albet it is one that is a minority compared to how ""common culture"" sees the women.

There are several things that i take issue with here. First is how objectification is defined in relation to sexuality and how it interacts with it. Feminists say that sexual attraction is not objectifying, to this i say how so? What makes up sexual attractions anyways and does it vary between the sexes? From what iv read ""normal"" female hetero sexuality takes into account a multitude of factors in order for there to be sexual attraction and or arousal. It is proposed that women take things like sent, personality, emotion, economic status etc.. into their view of sexuality. Men on the other hand are portrayed as being quite singlar when it comes to what attracts them, physical features. If i view a women and think ""wow that's a really sexy bird, quite the ass she has doesnt she"" then by this definition it is sexual objectification as i'm not really thinking about the women's personality or other features. I am, in that particular moment, thinking about her physical features regardless of other personal individual factors. If this is true then sexual objectification is a central pillar in hetero male sexuality. However there are some issues with this view. Firstly, lets just say that as a hetero male i meet with a women that i find attractive. Whos to say that when i think of her beautiful physical features i disregard her agency? In other words when i take notice of these things and think about them, i still have an understanding of that person's agency in mind ( or at least at the subconscious level). So it seems that sexual objectification, by the feminist definition, must be behavior that in principle, purposely denies agency. 

Porn is often something that is seen as creating a hypersexual male through objectifaction, i disagree with this. I remember the first days of my sexual understanding during puberty. At that time, i never layed eyes on porn yet i was incredibly attracted to my female peers. I would fantasize for hours while laying in bed, i was a incredibly horny little dude funny. i didn't even know how to masterbate at that age either. It was after about two years later when i found porn and began using it daily as a means of sexual release. Over time, i noticed that my sexual attraction towards women began to fade. More than a decade of porn usage has made me completely numb to the female figure so much so that i now consider myself grey asexual or Demisexual (kinda unsure to be honest) These were lasting changes to my sexaulity, i stoped masterbating around three years ago yet i still feel the same lack of sexual attraction (which i am very happy of, good riddance!). My point is this, porn seems to suck the sex drive out of men over time ( not just me but other men have talked about this happening too) so i ask this, why is porn a problem then? I agree that it does sexually objectify women and it can be explosive and degrading to them ( which is obviously a noteworthy problem) but when it comes to men picking up on and learning this behavior, i disagree. Maybe men do learn to think of women as sexual objects through porn, but riddle me this, if i see someone as a sex object yet do not have the *desire* to act upon that ""object"" then why does it matter? The grotesque image of the devalued women is something that is kept dormant in the mind and is something that is not acted upon because there is no desire left in the first place! Porn is a paradox in that it creates the mentality to objectify yet removes its potency as it numbs men's desire to objectify! Also most porn is kept inside a sexual context as well. I think that the objectification that is happening in the ""greater culture"" IE everyday life is far more toxic than anything consumed on something like pornhub.


Another thing about ""normal"" heterosexual behavior, does it even exist? Is there any biological/sociological proof that men are naturally simple in their sexual attraction while women are more varied? I remember some time ago in colledge, a girl approached me in the elevator she looked right into my eyes on the ride down, smiling. She greeted me as i did her when our eyes met. In this moment i felt a strong arousal not because of her physical features but because of i knew that she wanted me. I could *feel* her attraction towards me, the very fact that she wanted me, a fat smelly, hairy white dude was so incredibly flattering to me so much so that it actually turned me on. The way that she was looking at me and the vibes i got off her were crazy, i remember how big her eyes got. It's interesting to note that i've never seen this person before which means that her attraction toward me was not emotional or anything otherwise, it was purely physical, she found me physically attractive and made this known through her actions. I find it really annoying how men are portrayed as ""only thinking about one thing"" as well as being thought of as preditoral fuck machines. I like to think that im kinda not some inherent potential rapist just because im a man and for all of those that do think this, **fuck you!** As i said before, i don't care about sex in of itself, but i would love to have such a connection with a woman that i found intimacy with. I have found that sometimes, the more extreme varieties of feminism often portray men as predatory by nature even going so far as to say that all men are rapists in some way shape or form. I have to admit, upon seeing a lot of this stuff it really hurt my self esteem. Must i necessarily see women as objects just because i am a man? Am i a slave to my upbringing? Must i remain single and miserable for the rest of my life as to ""protect"" women from my ""savage"" urges as the evil oppressor? Must my love be seen as something that is but a divisive facade? Feminism has made me feel dirty and wicked, it made me question my value as a human being so much so that i considered suicided at one point. It is the reality of the situation that my kind are not welcome in your circles, regardless of what you tell me or other men. There lies a deep seated hatred for the oppressors so much so that i am seen as such and judged accordingly regardless of my agency or personhood. Because of this, i wont ever call myself feminist or clam to support this because i know in my heart that some of you will always hate me.

1,Chivalry. How do you feel about it?,"Hi everyone, I've just watched a YouTube video from Good Morning Britain (GMB) where Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid debated a woman who claimed that the concept of a man being chivalrous to a woman is patronising and belittling to women.

She gave examples of men holding doors open for women, saying things like ""ladies first"" and describing women as ""lovely"" is sexist as she claimed that it makes young women especially feel like men are belittling their capabilities, and making them feel like men are treating them as inferior, or even worse, treating women in this way because they expect something in return. 

Piers and Susanna, as well as the other guest on the show fully disagreed with this statement, with Susanna saying that if a man can't treat a woman as being special and treating them with care and affection, how is a woman to find a man who is genuinely a nice guy and start a romantic relationship, while Piers claimed that treating a woman this way is exactly the opposite of what the opposition was saying, saying that chivalry is nothing more than having good manners as well as a man doing what he has been taught by his mother and father as a child.

7,Is this an example of benevolent sexism?,"Posting from my throwaway.

I work in a medium security all male prison with several female co-workers. Even though we are medium security there is an area I will refer to as ""area D"" that houses high level male offenders that are mostly gang affiliated and very violent. Area D is split into two half separated by a divider to keep rival gangs sepparated. Male and female staff are routinely assigned to area D with two staff on each sides. As a side note, it is poor practice to leave a staff member (whether they be male or female) by themselves out of view because about 10 years ago there was an attempted murder on a male staff member.

Here is my question. I was working on one half of area D with two female staff members. I had to go to the other side of the divider that split the housing unit in half for just around 30 seconds to relay a message to the other side. While doing this a correctional officer on the other side ridiculed me for leaving the 2 female staff alone that I was working with because something could have happened to them.

What is your opinion on this? I know that its a dangerous environment and we are supposed to look out for each other but I know for a fact that nothing would have been said if both the staff members I left alone on the other side were male. 

I feel like if its too dangerous for women to go into that unit then the unit should be made off limits to female staff. However, if I was in a meeting with management and mentioned that women shouldn't be assigned there due to the danger levels I would be ridiculed for making a sexist statement. We hear all the time about how female COs can do just as good as a job as male COs but then talk the talk without walking the walk.

12,Questions about hip-hop culture/ men in general,"Question 1:**Can feminists really support hip-hop culture?**
From personal experience, I feel that derogatory things are used quite heavily (i.e referring to women as 'bitches' and sensationalising sex acts between them). However, from people who I talk to who call themselves feminists, I do find that they do listen to such music quite regularly. The fact that often they are in male company probably affects this, but if the way women are referred to affects them, shouldn't they speak up about this?

Question 2: **Can a man *actually* be a feminist?**
This for me depends on whether men are able to accept ""trash"" qualities about themselves, which people in general have difficulty doing (as accepting your faults generally leads to damaging your own ego, which is *harder than it sounds*). Also as a collective, humans tend to look out for their own kind before others and I think that applies to feminism as well.

Question 3: **Are there many male feminists on this sub?**
As I'm pretty new here I'm not very familiar with what goes on, but I'd be intrigued to here how many men are top-level commenters here.

13,Biology vs society?,"I love science. I’m a science lovin’ nutcase. And I find the more I learn about biology and genetics, the more I learn that men and women are equal. I used to believe women were better than men for a whole host of biological reasons. Actually I kind of still do but I value balance and I feel I am missing something, at least genetically.

Which is why I’m confused. Because it seems like to me, feminists fear biology. At least based on what I’m seeing in this sub. Any comment about male/female sexual dimorphism is met with tons of downvotes, regardless of the message behind the comment. But in my mind females are simply better biological specimens. I mean sure, we need men and women to survive and be cavemen and all that. But wow, females are badass. (Inb4 angry men come ranting about ‘men built the world we are better!’ Do you guys get that here btw?)

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00413-x

There’s lots of articles like that out there. I learned about this stuff in the genetics classes I’ve taken so I believe what they are saying.

Then we have society. It seems to me like everything on the feminist sub is put on society. Which is fine to some extent because obviously society influences us a ton. But I feel like it’s taken a bit too far. We are animals and we evolved a certain way. The differences in men and women compliment eachother and make both sides stronger overall. Why does it seem like on the feminism sub, they act like men and women are 100% exactly the same. I mean surely nobody is making that claim, that’s just silly. But it seems like that claim is basically being acted out maybe subconsciously?

Or is it 100% society and y’all have evidence for that? Cuz that would be really interesting honestly lol.

Edit: I feel like every response is holding back hostility. I don’t know what to do. I consider myself a feminist, I’m on y’all side. If someone wants to actually talk to me I’d love it. Otherwise I’m gonna just leave this thread. I don’t want to talk to angry individuals who think I’m here for a debate.

I can’t just... never get angry, I’m not Mr. Rogers. I get frustrated sometimes. I get annoyed sometimes. I even get downright angry sometimes. But it seems that even just having a grouchy look on my face is enough to scare the hell out of a woman, so... what am I supposed to do about that?

35,If a female approches her female friend,"If a woman approached a female friend of her at a party in a persistent way, asking for a kiss, for 3/4 times and every time the answer is no, in a direct and respectful way.

And this friend replies with a complete non sense of excuses ""it was a party, we were all drunk and everyone was having fun and a lot of people were kissing each other"" and then she apologize and then say ""are you crazy! This hasn't happened "" and lie about the details to make it sound as if she was asking for a kiss on the cheek, with no sexual desire behind it at all and then yell and start insulting.

46,Should Corporal Punishment Be Illegal?,"I believe that corporal punishment distributed to your children(or in the school by teachers)should be illegal...it has been documented throughout various research,that spanking your children has negative consequences to their psychological development.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447048/

It has been shown that children who were physically punished,tend to develop low self-esteem,more aggression and antisocial behaviour.

http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2002/06/spanking.aspx

Obviously there's the moral statue of this case,that physically spanking your children is IMMORAL...there are far better ways to discipline your children...especially a parent should be strict(when needed)and enforce proper boundaries,they can do that by teaching their child to respect them from a young age,or by managing the child's behaviour.

Corporal punishment can lead to increased violence in our society...think about it when you spank your children,you teach them that violence is the answer,you basically coddle them into that mentality and you make them more likely to act out in violent behaviours in the future(criminal activity,substance abuse,poor moral internalisation,dropping out of education etc).

http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/research/impact-corporal-punishment.html

Corporal punishment is encased in sexist components,parents tend to spank their sons,while their sons are being taught to take it,it reinforces harmful sexist stereotypes,that men have to be tough and endure physical violence,whereas the same thing is not being implemented to girls(parents are more likely to spank their daughters)...ergo,actively leading to preservation of toxic masculinity.

Therefore corporal punishment should be illegal,due to the reasons stated above.

I am not proposing that “alpha male” is a natural, biological trait. I also understand that nearly all men who are considered alpha are not violent offenders, but they often have psychopathic characteristics, e.g., lack of empathy, lack of honesty, disposition towards manipulation, norm violations, preoccupation with being seen as the leader of their social groups through status and wealth creation, etc.

Is there any research showing whether societies that have increased civic participation in advancing women’s rights have less women attracted to alpha males? Or research that shows these societies contain less norms that men should mimic alpha traits if they want to find partners?

60,Feminist hypocrisy: fat acceptance vs. human sexuality?,"Hey, there. So, something has been really bugging me about what feminists are saying about men and our sexuality.

--

On one hand, feminists are campaigning very hard to have overweight women be seen as ""attractive"" by the mainstream of society. They are advocating more plus-size models, encouraging body positivity, etc. Some have gone so far as to say that men who would not date fat women are actual bigots.

On the other hand, you accuse men who are into overweight women of ""fetishizing"" them. You guys claim that BBW porn involving fat women ultimately hurts them specifically. I recently stumbled across the dating profile of an overweight woman who stated: ""no closet chubby chasers"". **Isn't that exactly the kind of guy who she would want pursuing her? A guy who finds her attractive?**

--

**There is a contradiction here:** You guys want fat women to be seen as attractive, yet you shame men who are attracted to fat women.

Personally, I love women who have curves, a soft belly, or a few extra pounds. I find them more attractive than a size 0 (no hate for size 0 women; I'm just stating my personal preference). Of course I want sex, but I also want a loving, healthy relationship, and I would never lead a heavier girl on just to get into the sheets with her.

**Now look:** because men who refuse to date fat women are ""body-shamers"", and men who pursue them are ""fetishizing"", the ONLY men who this leaves left are those who *literally do not care about looks*. I imagine that this portion of men is quite small.

69,"When pursuit of truth collides with activism, what do you value more?","Most of the time, I think contemporary feminist ideals tend to align with science. But I recently read a book by Alice Dreger, a feminist, science historian, and intersex activist, who explored some rather fascinating incidents where science and activism collide. 

In the worst cases, when feminists (or other liberal activists) found legitimate scientific research to be threatening, it resulted in slander, intentional use of social media to spread lies, misinformation, and misinterpretations of the work, and even threats of violence against the authors. Often this was sparked by a few activists, but those few tended to have a lot of influence, and many followers tended to go with the party-line rather than go to the source (which unfortunately has a high educational barrier and is hard to get a-hold of due to pay-walls).

But this got me thinking about the purpose of activism and whether the activist should be concerned about truth or its pursuit at all. It seems like it is the duty of an activist to do what they can to achieve their goals for social change. While it maybe a fallacy to imply social values from scientific conclusions, many people do commit this fallacy, giving scientific work a political and social impact. And that impact maybe of concern to an activist who has some set of cultural and political goals in mind.

Some modern philosophers like John Stuart Mill give enormous value to truth and its pursuit, so much that they would almost never sacrifice it except under the strictest of conditions.

75,What do you think about these statements? Are them distorted beliefs or accurate reflections of reality?,"The following statements are directed for men. It's a copy-and-paste from the FAQ of /r/TheRedPill

I'd like to know what is your opinion about this, not necessarily all of them; just the ones you disagree the most.

""Feminists claim they want equality but what they really want is power without responsibility. They desire both male and female privilege consolidated into one, thus upsetting the gender balance. They want the privileges of being women (privilege such as being economically provided for, getting opportunities based on their beauty and protection from physical harm by others) as well as male privilege (authority, respect for having a career, to not be judged so harshly based on appearance etc) which is neither pragmatic nor realistic, it ignores the biological basis for how the genders perceive each other in the ignorance that ""everything is a social construct!"" and we are mostly ""the same"" when quite evidently this is not the case.

Women are irrational and inconsistent, they have a capacity for logic but it is not their modus operandi, that is to say that they must exert effort to be logical as it is not their factory setting. A logical woman is easily baited into becoming emotional; women are easy to compromise. Their decisions are based on their current emotional state rather than the abstraction of logic. It's this proclivity to change so quickly which causes them to act inconsistently and in contradiction.

Women are machiavellian in nature, this means they are comparatively proficient at being manipulative versus the typical male. The evolutionary theoretical basis for this is due to smaller size and inferior musculature women had to learn to use men as tools rather than directly oppose them in a physical conflict (as they would undoubtedly lose in all but very few scenarios) this makes the pronunciation of their strength a propensity to be mentally rather than physically violent. Physical violence is outlawed whereas mental abuse is not, this allows women to get their way without being held accountable by a system of law. The law does not legislate interpersonal morality to this extent. Where a man's instinct is to hit, a woman's is to do a big shit in your mind instead.

Race does not matter if you are rich. A lot of you are small-minded and stuck on the superficial, white-black-arab-indian-asian whatever, you have a certain perception of the world based upon your culture, perhaps where you live the white man is god, but know all racial barriers are overcome by power, money is power, if you're a 5' asian with a 2 inch dick that girls laugh at a 7 digit bank balance is sure to offset that. Focus less on your race and more on your success, your insecurities will get you no where. The real segregation is between rich and poor and that is even more true when it comes down to women, never forget that. Rich vs. poor is the only thing that matters in this world, white vs black, west coast vs east coast, all these other ""beefs"" are a minor, they are all symptoms of wealth inequality, the bottom line is wealth. Rich vs poor motherfuckers.

Women are hypergamous they feel entitled to a superior mate. You have to be richer than her or at least equally rich, more educated than her or at least equally educated. You need to be better looking than her or at least equal looking, you need to be more popular than she is or at least equally popular. You can offset one area (LMS - looks, money, status) with another, but if you're lower in at least 2 areas just forget it.

Buying into the last point, this is why 20% of guys are fucking 80% of the chicks, women date up, men date down and yes this has created rising social inequality since women entered the professions

If a woman thinks she is better than you she can't respect you, if she can't respect you she can't love you. Women love men differently to the way men love women. Woman's love is based on adoration, adoration is a concentrated amount of respect. Respect is derived from power. Be powerful if you want to be loved, or you will never be loved. You will be held in contempt for being weak.

Women rely on men to be emotionally stoic, we often call this ""holding frame"" you have to be mentally strong so she can lean on you, she finds that attractive. You cannot lean on her, there is a double standard, if you lean on her the relationship will fall apart, she will not be able to handle your problems and she will no longer find you attractive. You are a man. You have to be better than her, which means to be stronger than she is. This is why women get to be emotional and we have to be unreactive, we are strong and ignore our emotions so they can indulge in their emotions and enjoy the ride. They find it far more difficult to be logical than we do and thus it is our burden to be the reasonable ones.

Always set boundaries, with everyone. Do not be a pushover. This is probably the most important bulletpoint here.

Buying into the last point women have little sympathy for weak men, despite the fairer sex bullshit you may be accustomed to hearing a man is far more likely to assist a weak man financially or emotionally than a woman is.

Women are more selfish than men are in matters of money and love. Man's love is expected to be sacrificial, woman's isn't.

Women love pragmatically and have no capacity to love unconditionally for romantic partners, only their children. Men can love women unconditionally. There is a hierarchy of love: Men &gt; Women &gt; Children.

Women have a pronounced gender group bias which means they typically de facto side with other women in a conflict regardless of logic or argument, women are herd like and stick together closely, they form cartels and use the power of the group to hen peck/destroy enemies.

Women have a sexual plurality, if you are a nice guy with money you are husband material that can nail her after 12 dates and she's had so many glasses of wine she forgets how on a primal level you're not that attractive, just cute. If you are an asshole with nice muscles you're the guy who gets to nail her after 2 hours of meeting. We call this sexual plurality in rather rhythmic slang: ""alpha fucks, beta bucks""

Women do not care about male weakness and neither does society, if you are weak, depressed, small, poor, uneducated, unconfident, not powerful then nobody cares. People only care about you when you're powerful or a pretty woman. You have to pull yourself up by the bootstraps because nobody gives a fuck about you. Society will always have a safety net for women, white knights will charge in, the state will provide and etc, as a man you have no such luxury, your propensity and ability to gain power is much higher than a woman's but your ability to hit rock bottom is far more pronounced too. As men we are more extreme than women. Women are typically average and don't move much either side of the bell curve, as men we are either highly successful geniuses of repute that feminists can but scoff and be jealous of, the posterboys for their esteemed patriarchy, or the ignored voiceless poverty stricken peasant class that nobody gives a flying fuck about.

The law prioritises female safety and well-being over logic, honour and justice. Family law has been corrupted and is now controlled by feminist ideological dogma. The constitutions equitable maxims are rewritten by modern statutes, Rollo Tomassi of Rational Male did a very relevant article on this topic here: http://therationalmale.com/2014/01/14/the-second-set-of-books/

Western females (typically anglosphere and western/northern Europe) are self-entitled and come from a psychological position of thinking they're better than you are. They believe that shit despite their numerous insecurities because they have been raised to view men as instruments for their desires, they have been told they must be impressed,that a man must wine and dine her and ultimately the onus is on him to win her heart, she will obsess over her relationship status frantically and doll herself up but ultimately her part is entirely passive. She comes from a position of superiority and illogically believes she is superior to all but the most high value of men. Part of the red pill is realising her capacity for brilliance is lower than yours, which brings me on to the next point.

Women need men more than men need women. Men generally want sex and perhaps a family so they have a genetic lineage to leave their worldly goods and knowledge to once they die (so they may live on through their offspring) however women need men for their logical minds and stoic consistency, to make her emotionally stabilised ""being the rock in her storm"", and also need a partner just to ""feel complete."" Just look at single mother households and all the older women who are single, they are miserable. These women NEED a man to be happy, men DO NOT need women to be happy, men need SEX to be happy. A bachelor is a not an unhappy guy, a bachelorette is.

Women are depreciating assets, their major asset and unique selling point is their sexual beauty and fertility. Most of them squander their best years on ""riding the cock carousel"" which means fucking lots of different guys in nightclubs, having flings, being generally irresponsible and riding through life on easy mode getting ahead for no real talent, but because she's pretty and can give head. Women are born, their ability to conceive children is what makes them women.

Men are not born they are created. Poverty, difficulty, heartache, oppression, pain - these are the things that make men out of boys. This is why you came to TRP. This is why boys come back from the military as men. Conflict and pain is what forges the masculine mindset, men cannot grow without conflict and learning from their mistakes, men need to apply their logical minds to problems which arise, elevate, and transcend their previous selves to become more powerful. Men are never born, they are always bred in the bloody fields of battle and war be it economic, mental or physical. A man is a soldier of differing kinds, a man has learnt to repress his fear so he may overcome and achieve.

Men take more risks than women and are expected to do so, being fearful, unconfident and risk averse as a man leads to failure. You must be confrontational and risk-taking.

Single mothers [typically] breed boys not men (without outside intervention.) Boys do little except play xbox and eat pizza with no direction in life, they have little luck with girls and end up drinking themselves to dead smoking pot in their 40s. There's more women in education than men now. Think about that shit for a second. The system has been set up against you, pull yourself up by the bootstraps.

The red pill is about pragmatism and truth based on observation, it is not idealistic, in some ways you can say it is liberal - but it is not liberal in the idealistic pseudo academic sense your institutions have taught you to perceive it as. Liberalism has become corrupted. Liberals today censor and silence opposing opinions, I'm not talking about political parties I'm talking about ideologically left leaning people, their thoughts and ideas are based in idealism not directly measurable truth, liberalism has become the religion to pragmatisms science.

Social market value is everything, something a low value man says which is ""creepy"" when said by a high value man is ""flirty"" or ""sexy."" Always be focusing on your physical appearance and make it the best that you can, this will make your life easier in all areas, not just sexually but financially too as caused by a phenomenon explored known as the halo effect

Your value is everything you should always be improving yourself, if you're not then you cannot compete in the world and your life will be miserable, anesthetized by nothing but the introversion of the four walls you reside in kept docile by xbox, porn, pizza and some online friends. Break free of the mediocrity.

Your diet and exercise place a certain handicap on your ability to utilise your potential. The obese and those who eat poorly (but aren't necessarily fat) are typically low energy and thus waste a lot of time unproductively as they are not in the right mental state to get anything done. You need to take care of your body so then your body will allow your mind to implement it's will onto the world. You must be physically active so that you can mentally put your plans into action. Procrastination is the slow acting poison of one who lives a sedentary lifestyle. Physically active people make things happen in other areas of their life too. Exercise is invigorating. Stop putting it off. Do it.

Your body is the temple that houses your mind, following on from the previous point higher testosterone will help you increase your abilities and leave you feeling more energetic - lift, it will give you a rush of energy like nothing else and further increase your T creating a positive feedback cycle. Jog/do cardio - a runners high again is like a drug, you will feel awesome after a jog, your anxiety goes right down and your confidence rises.

But I can't find anywhere why this is. Feminism to the best of my knowledge is the advocacy of women with the aim of making an empowered female positive society. With this goal in mind male advocacy seems at best redundant, at worst counterproductive. 

Campaigning for men is surely taking away resources better used in pursuing the main goal, not even mentioning the point is to surely to reduce the rights of men not increase them?

 Perhaps most puzzling to me is that  men are the barrier to the success of feminism and reason it needs to exist. It's not like the Black Panthers fought for the legal rights of the KKK.

So what are the reasons for Feminism's focus on men or am I overstating the focus and it's more lip service?

In many cases, these stereotypes are completely false, although it then makes me wonder, why did they exist in the first place?

I don't think its just "" *blank* tend to do this just because society said *blank* should be like this"" because then why does society think like this? Because previous society educated it like that. And the society prior to that educated the previous society. If you go far enough, we get to the evolution of modern humans where there is no society to say ""hey, you should grow up like this"". Yet these gender roles still existed. To me, this means that to some degree there MUST be at least a little grain of truth in some of these stereotypes, and that man and woman are to some extent biologically different aside from genitals. I still do think that you should not discriminate anyone because of that, but I do think ""because society"" isn't a great argument.

Why would I bother to call myself a feminist, since everyone is already for equality?  

It seems to me that the only reason why feminists and non-feminists, and other feminists disagree is because everyone has different information that they believe to be facts, and they're not trying to understand each other. Like how some people that believe women make 70% of what men make for the same amount of work, and some people think men and women make the same but women earn less because society manipulates them into taking lower wages, and some other people who think women are biologically less ambitious in the workplace, etc etc. Everyone discussing this wants equality, but only one group of people distinguishes themselves as something else.

88,"Am I wrong in thinking there is such a thing as ""feminist dogma""","OK, so I don't call myself a feminist (or an MRA, MGTOW, or any of that non-sense). I'm not a great wordsmith either (I'm an engineer), so if something comes across a tad blunt, just bear with. I'm not trying to upset anyone. I've read a couple of questions here, and most of them yield some more nuanced responses than other places where I've looked.

My position: While I agree that there is work that needs to be done to get a more egalitarian society, I often find myself disagreeing on some of the premises put forward by feminists. As someone working in tech, I genuinely believe our industry could benefit from having more women in the workforce. At the same time, I simply don't buy the argument that our culture is to ""bro"", let alone misogynistic and we wouldn't accept women.
It's really hard to take this argument seriously, especially from people who have no interest in joining the industry.

I believe people will act in accordance to where their passion lies. They will be drawn to things they find interesting. As we observe throughout the natural world (of which humans are a part), male and female behaviours are different. Sometimes it seems like feminism today is focused on the annihilation of any and all behavioural differences between men and women. Terms like toxic masculinity is an example of this, as is the feminisation of education.
This seems to be a point where I keep hitting ""feminist dogma"". Whenever I put forth my belief that, as a society, we might stand to benefit from accepting the differences along the gender divide, and together try and work out how to take advantage of them. I truly believe there is a biological element here (to what extent I don't know), and I think we can all agree that biology is something we haven't yet fully mastered.

To be absolutely clear, my position can be summarised as: ""Yes, men are more inclined to work in the STEM fields, they're more likely to be interested in geeky stuff that requires some degree of anti-social behaviour. For that reason, 50-50 male female ratio's are unlikely to happen. Much in the same way that you're less likely to find male teachers, especially the younger the students get. It seems to be a field that will be female dominated.""

What I'm looking for here:
genuine engagement. If you can point out where I'm wrong, and link me to some articles, feel free. I'm happy to admit where I'm wrong
A more nuanced view than the one I find all over the place (one where the differences between men and women are all sociological in nature, and made up, and it's all patriarchy).
A woman here who works in the same industry. I know a few, and none of them have told me they find the industry to ""bro"", but perhaps others might have different experiences. Increasing the sample size can only help

I have had chemistry tutors completely abandon me during their office hours to help a female student in a class they aren't even instructing. 
I have had female climbing partners pulled from our group by other male climbers desperate to teach them a new technique of skill. While I would have to pay for similar instruction as no random stranger would spend the same time on me at no cost.

I concede that both these instances the females were attractive, and there may be an underlying desire kept by these men to help these women excel because of ulterior motive.

90,"I need help dealing with slightly sexist, privileged, younger brother.","Please if this is the wrong sub, point me in the right direction. I need help!

I was recently on a road trip with my dad and brother. We stayed over at some old friends of my dad’s and we spent the night drinking whiskey and debating politics. All of us are pretty liberal, except my brother who has lived in rural America for the past five years. I am 29, he is 27, we are all white. I think after five years out in the middle of nowhere, he has started to lean more to the right, which in and of itself is not a problem. 

But at the end of the night my brother confronted me. He was really upset, he was shaking and close to crying. He told me that when I make jokes about white male privilege that I am demeaning him. That he has worked very hard all through college, and the past five years at his job. (He has a very good job, and he has made it a fair ways up the hierarchy at his org for someone so young, but that has come at the cost of living a life that can be lonely at times). 

He told me that he was giving me an ultimatum: that if I didn’t tone down the way I talk, our relationship will change. Oddly enough, the segment of discussion he took issue with wasn’t actually an attack on white privilege. But he took it personally, anyway. He didn’t want to have a discussion, but he kept trying to make his point, and when I tried to explain myself, he continually cut me off and undermined me. We both quickly realized that we needed to talk about all of this sober, so we hugged, said goodnight, and we plan on talking about it after the road trip - so we could enjoy the rest of the trip with our dad. 

FWIW, the discussion he was upset about when I made the joke about white privilege was in no way related to him - it was about the men at the occupation of the Mahleur wildlife refuge out in Oregon, and if they had been any other color there would not have been a stand off, they would have been shot in short order. 

The rest of the trip went pretty smoothly, but for me it was like I was awake for the first time. Suddenly I noticed that my brother doesn’t respect me, which is going to complicate our discussion. His behavior made it very clear, and I realized he had been treating me in the same manner for the past several years - I just had never noticed before. 

When I tried to join the conversation he was having with my dad the next day he told me to calm down, which was out of place because we were having a benign conversation about trucks, but to keep things smooth I sat back and let my brother and dad talk. It was frustrating that my dad then made the same point that I had just been shushed for, but my brother could hear the point coming from my dad, and he told my dad that it was a good idea. 

It made me realize that my brother routinely tells me to calm down, or when I try to talk about something I want to talk about it is typically met with derision - he will roll his eyes, or tell me I am being silly, or sarcastically ask if we are really going to go “there” already. 

…I love my brother and want nothing more than a heartfelt and wholesome relationship with him. I do not know how to get from where we are now to that end goal. If he doesn’t respect me, if he is blind to his own privilege, if he is stuck in the “broke white male” stereotype how do I have this discussion with him?

92,Do you think it's a problem that feminism encourages people to have fewer children?,"So, here's my concern. Studies show that:

1. Feminists have fewer kids.

2. Feminists are, on average, more intelligent.

3. IQ, which contrary to layman belief is an incredibly reliable metric, is highly hereditary (r = 0.6 - 0.8). (edit: [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ) wikipedia's decent summary of the heritability issue, and [the validity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics) of the g-factor that IQ seeks to measure)

What's more, they tend to have children at later ages, which correlates with a greater rate of de-novo mutations and so some evidence suggests is correlated with lower IQ.

The long-term implications are obvious: smarter people will have fewer kids, and so society will get dumber.

Now you can say ""that doesn't give society the right to restrict my choices!"" and we can debate whether that's right or not, but even if it is, that doesn't actually solve the problem.

I am **not** ashamed of the choice but my parents and my friends are a little persistent that I not talk about it. My fiancée's family is very strict Catholics so that complicates things.

96,Why am I more successful with feminist women after I tell them I'm non-feminist and/or anti-feminist?,"I'm a male college student.  I've noticed that for some reason, when I tell the feminist women I meet for the first time that I'm not a feminist and even if I say that I'm antifeminist, I'm more successful with them than the ones who I don't mention it with.  The ones who that I don't talk about feminism with might add me on Facebook but I never hear back from them.  But when the topic comes up the first time I meet them, I tell them that that I'm not a feminist and that my views are almost entirely antifeminist.  The ones who hear that will add me on Facebook and/or give me their cell phone numbers and they will actually like me enough to respond to me.  I've never had a relationship before, but I've had a couple dates and my closer female friends (not just acquaintances) are feminists.  I've even dropped the MRA bomb and the ones who I tell that to still like me.

For some background, I come from a long line of feminists.  My mom is a feminist, my grandmother was a feminist, and I think my great grandmother was a feminist.  So by virtue of socialization, I used to identify as a feminist for as long as I can remember up until around 2015, which is when I completely flipped positions and became a staunch antifeminist after I learned about what happened to one of my friends and its connection to feminism.

I have a friend who was a male victim of intimate partner violence.  His girlfriend used to beat him with various objects lying around their apartment and one day she broke one of his ribs with a rolling pin.  When the police arrived, she shed some crocodile tears about being afraid and they arrested him even though she didn't have a scratch on her.  He was blamed, told to stop beating his girlfriend, and made to attend a ""batterer's treatment program"" where he had to flagellate himself for his maleness, his masculinity, his male privilege, and admit that he was abusing his girlfriend (even though he did nothing of the sort and it was quite the opposite) because he desired power and control. Nothing bad happened to her even though it was clear that she was lying, and she was comforted, given services, and even praised by feminists for standing up to her ""abusive"" boyfriend.

When this first happened, I thought that it was absolutely screwed up, but had no idea why it happened.  A couple months later, I stumbled upon the men's movement and learned about gender symmetry in domestic violence and the Duluth Model, which is what our domestic violence policies are based on and why my friend was treated the way he was. When I found out that the Duluth Model is entirely rooted in radical feminist ideology and is in place due to fervent lobbying by feminist organizations, everything clicked and made sense and I decided that I could no longer be a feminist.  I could no longer support a movement that was not only lying to me my entire life about domestic violence and other issues regarding gender, but that that the people I was aligning myself with have actually been **hurting** people this entire time and continues to do so.

I tell this story because it's what got me interested in law (my major is political science) and is why I'm interested in pursuing a legal profession.  And I also do it because to some, the decision of not identifying as a feminist is baffling, but going from feminist to non-feminist to anti-feminist is even more baffling.  

When I tell them my story, I often hear ""that's a better reason for not liking feminism than most that I've heard.""  Others might say something along the lines of ""that's not necessarily the fault of feminism"" (which it is) or ""they're not real feminists"" (which they are, and if they aren't, then it doesn't matter because they're the ones in all the positions of influence.)  But no matter what they say, they're all surprisingly OK with it.

But it only works if they're female, I'm talking to them individually, and if I'm talking to them in real life.  The male ones and the ones on the internet flip.  I go to a very left leaning and one of the most politically active universities in the country where 60% of the students are female, so feminism is really popular and people are really passionate about it.  I know that this works on feminists because some of them care enough about it to go to the women's march and/or take a gender studies class.  At the moment, I can think of some possible reasons.

- Feminist women, or at least some of them, don't like feminist men and non-feminist men are hard to come by.

- On the flip side, it could be because they know I'm not a misogynist since I used to be a feminist and I switched sides for the reasons I have given above.

- They might admire the guts that it takes to openly say that I'm anti-feminist on this campus.  I have never met someone who is openly anti-feminist.  The only non-feminists are either people who don't care enough about politics to pick sides or they're secretly anti-feminist but are too afraid to say anything because they're worried about being ostracized and harassed by the mob. 

- They might find my difference in views interesting

- They don't care about ideology.  I know some of them have said that.  I'm in that category.  I don't care about people's ideologies.  I just care about whether they're an asshole or not

- On other political issues, I'm moderate and prefer not to align with a party and I don't take stances on topics that I don't claim to know enough about.

- Despite being strongly against feminism, I don't hate most of the grassroots members. There's definitely a spectrum with the people with good intentions but are being misled by academics and special interest groups with ulterior motives on one end (which is where most of them are), and the man-hating female supremacists on the other.  It's definitely a more sympathetic view because most anti-feminists will brush you all off as man-haters and I don't think that's the case.

- I'm not ugly and people tell me that I'm more attractive than I think, but I'm no Adonis and I don't have the kind of body that drives women wild.  So I know it's not looks for all of them

97,"Your thought on the ""loss of control""?","(I'm not here to anger anyone, but if my post does, so apologize in advance.)

I've read some essays discussing men's ""feel of power"" and their view on feminism. Basically, what they said was that the more a man felt himself lose control of his own life, be it health or finance, the easier he could be drawn to a negative view of feminism. These essays then concluded that it was understandable why so many men of the lower class, especially Americans who were treated unfairly and feel themselves helpless under the current system, treated feminism as a threat to the moral standards.

What is your thought about this opinion? Does it have any validity? And if so, can we draw a line further and say that why so many young financially-independent people accept (""accept"" and not ""actively participating"") feminism is because they feel like they still have the power over their lives and do not have anything to blame others?

102,Women not being allowed to achieve/maxing out value,"This is a half-baked thought that struck me on my commute today, so sorry if this rambles a little.

The short version: I'm thinking that men and women are valued by completely different measures (eg. men are valued for what they can produce, women are valued for their beauty/sexual value), but that women's value ""tops out"" earlier than that of men. Additionally, I'm thinking that this phenomenon translates over into other spheres like competition, and I'm wondering if that's widespread.

Example: Olympic 10-meter Air Rifle. This is a weirdly gendered thing. The event is different for men and women. The men's event is comprised of 60 shots, for a possible 600 points, at which point a final 10 shots determines a winner. The women's event, on the other hand, is comprised of only 40 shots, for a possible 400 points, at which point the same final round happens. I'm an avid shooter myself (though nowhere near competition level) and I can't think of any reason the women's event should have fewer shots and a lower maximum score, other than to ensure that women's scores never compare with men's.

And I was thinking that this is similar to the way women and men are valued. Men are valued based largely on their achievements - what they can produce, or more importantly, what they can earn, while women seem to be valued on appearance. But it's like men are playing with a higher quantity of available ""points"", awarded on a different distribution. Are you handsome? Great, you get ten points. Work at McDonalds? Well, you have a job, so you get five points, but that's it. Tradesman? 25 points. You're middle of the road. Day Trader on Wall Street? 45 points, you stud. Combined with the 10 you get for handsome, you're right near the top of the pile.

For women, it's more like ""Are you pretty? Great, here's 30 points. Do you have a job? Good for you, here's *five* points. Whether you're a barista at Starbuck's or a lawyer, you still get five points. Cured cancer? Okay, here's eight points. *There's nothing you can do that will let you break 40 points.*

I'm talking here about the perceived value of an individual *as a person within society*, not as an employee in a company or anything like that. And with that in mind, while it seems to me men have to work harder for their ""points"" (they need to achieve something that takes more effort and skill than putting on some makeup or doing their hair nicely) they have a whole field of ""bonus points"" that is simply not available to women.

So my question: Do you think the above is a reasonable way of thinking about how things currently stand in terms of how individuals are valued? And secondly, do any of you know of more examples like the Air Rifle event in which women are actually arbitrarily limited in their achievement? Do we see this ""lower possible high score"" phenomenon elsewhere or often?",AskFeminists,1522822120,Stavrogin78,27,12,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/89mytt/women_not_being_allowed_to_achievemaxing_out_value/,2018-04-04
103,How would you respond to claims/critics about the Women's march,"""The #WomensMarch2018 is peak cringe but it will do no use counter-trolling them with a ""Men's March"".  We don't need the latter anyway, what we DO need is a Family March.  Family is what you get when women and men work together.  We need more of that...

I support women's rights, but we seem to forget that this is America, not the Middle East where women are treated like crap, are forced to completely submit to their abusive husbands and dress a certain way or they will be flogged.  Where are feminists on that?

Women have it perfectly fine in America.  Calm down.  Saying shit like ""SCREW THE PATRIARCHY"" or ""F**K WHITE MEN!!"" will not do anything.  Imagine if guys went around saying horrible things like that or dressing in giant dick costumes...

If anyone stands by the Women's March, you being lied to and do not realize how truly blessed women are.  This mentality that women are inferior in the West and that the only way to fight back is through hating men is ruining gender relations and friendships all over America...
Men and women are meant to compliment one another and the feminist movement is splitting them apart.  Support women's rights but don't do it at the expense of misandry.  Hate does not kill hate, only love can.

This movement is so incredibly toxic.  It's no wonder men are more afraid of women this day and age, because feminism is turning them into awful human beings.""

106,Do you think that dating apps reinforce gender roles?,"As I am sure that a lot of you know, dating apps take advantage over the connection people make with each other. In this heteronormative society, this often means it takes advantage of the connections women make with men. 

But at what point does it become systemically sexist? 

Women and men on these apps are usually normal people. There is apparently a 50/50 split between gender demographics on [Tinder](https://www.bustle.com/articles/154205-heres-how-many-women-vs-men-use-tinder). And yet there is a difference in their behavior. Women are often spammed with messages in their inboxes, while men are lucky to even get a reply. Why is this?

Well, for one, women often do not send the first message. This is a role expected of men. But why? Because women on these apps appear to be a [much higher commodity than men](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a). With so many men initiating messages to women, it leaves women the opportunity to simply sit back and take their picking.

This means that on these apps, women have the power over men. And so you find companies realizing this and introduce premium features such as Tinder Gold. If logic is of any value, one could reasonably hypothesize that, due to the popularity of women and unpopularity of men on these apps, men are primary target of these services.

Economically and culturally, it seems that dating apps have shifted the balance of power over to women. It is acceptable for a woman to write ""no fuckboys please"", but if a man wrote ""I don't date whores"", he would likely be flagged and reported. 

Has this empowerment truly created an equal platform for women? Is it not perpetuation of gender roles for the men to be expected to pay to snag a date? Is the popularity of women simply a result of objectification? Is this merely not another technological gender role that we have artificially created for ourselves? This is what feminism has been fighting against for decades, and yet many people willingly buy into these apps.

What do you think? If you use dating apps, what is your experience like?

125,"What if women, on average, just don't want to do the same things as men?","I'm a women in STEM, but not a feminist. I actually have a lot of issues with modern feminism. One of them if the idea of blank slates and legitimate phycological differences between men and women. First time posting here so if I break any rules please don't get to mean.

We have different DNA, different hormones, it seems like a reasonable ideas that there is some difference between our average phycology that is rooted in biology and not society. I think that women should absolutely have the same opportunity as men, and just because there it's a difference in averages between men and women doesn't mean all individuals will follow the trend.

But maybe, because of these differences, women on average literally legitimately do not want to be in STEM. And trying to get the gender ratio in STEM to be even is actually pushing some women towards a life they don't really want or would enjoy.

I'm not saying that this is necessarily the case. I think that the biological basis for our behavior is far too interwined with culture to be confident about any differences being natural. But I think we should be open to the idea. And we shouldn't take a skew in the gender ratio to mean discrimination or there is an issue.

129,Diversity in games and movies,"I have been wondering want feminist stances are on diversity mainly on forced diversity in games and movies.

Why was this such a huge issue in the first place not accounting what the game creators tried to get historical accuracy but what happen if the creators did this without thinking should they be forced to add minorities to their creation. Also, to another media piece the movie call Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children had a similar problem to some people where it didn’t have many minority in it claiming the director and caster of the film to be racist for not having diversity, but again what happen if they did this without thinking or those children was just best for the role than some other, so should they just be first to make sure if they have minorities.

130,Question about submission in BDSM contexts,"There's a common conservation that I see unfold several times each month in some of the BDSM and sex subreddits as well as IRL. It typically follows the following format, more or less:

1. A woman is trying to reconcile feeling like a feminist and the desire to submit to a man (generally this question doesn't come up when submitting to anyone who isn't a man).
2. She's told that being a feminist means that she gets to choose to submit or not.
3. Someone chimes in with the idea that she could never really consent to submitting because [patriarchy, societal conditioning, etc.]

Part 3 there never sits right with me because I believe adult women are capable of making their own decisions, and I find it condescending to suggest that they aren't, but some people really swear by it, so what's the deal with that?

131,What do you think is the cause of sex/gender differences in neurodivergence? What should be done about it?,"Alright, full disclosure here: I am both a person with autism, and an educator who works with children with autism, so my thinking on this does come from my body of work.  However, I’m a field worker, not a researcher, and don’t have all the answers, so I’m not in a position to talk with total authority on this, and I’m asking for personal opinions on what should happen more than declaration of the facts.  I’ll try to be brief with my existing thoughts.

I’ve seen a lot of change (and some development) in the way that we, as a culture, treat neurodivergence (mental or psychological disorders), but our understanding of these things still has a long way to go.  One of the ways that I think our understanding needs to emerge is the way in which we treat diagnosis, especially where our current understanding leaves us with an unusual demographic breakdown.  For example, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, one of the most frequent neurodivergent diagnoses, [is diagnosed over three times as often in boys as in girls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder).  Autism Spectrum Disorders [are diagnosed over four times as often in boys as in girls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum).  There have been multiple suggested causes for this wide discrepancy, with both sex differences and differences in gender expression being floated as reasons, but as far as I know, there isn’t a scientific consensus, or a definite solution.

The way I see it, there are only a few possible *outcomes* (not causes) that can be true.  **Either:**

-	These sex differences in diagnoses accurately reflect the actual rate of incidence; **or**  
-	These sex differences in diagnoses are inaccurate, and boys are over-diagnosed; **and/or**  
-	These sex differences in diagnoses are inaccurate, and girls are under-diagnosed.

In my opinion, if these sex differences in diagnoses are accurate, then they are probably indicative of actual sex differences between boys and girls that cause, for example, boys to be more likely to have autism, or ADHD.  This is something that is already accepted and understood with some physical ailments and disabilities, and is true of some genetic disorders, such as [Rett Syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome) (which used to be considered an autism spectrum disorder, and exclusively affects women), but is relatively unexplored territory for common neurological and mental disorders.  In that case, I think we, as feminists (and just ethical people in general), need to think about how we can be considerate of sex-linked neurodivergence.

If these sex differences in diagnoses are *not accurate*—either because of over-diagnosis of boys or under-diagnosis of girls—then the disparity between diagnosis and actual incidence is probably because of gender expression or cultural issues, and this cultural influence harms either boys or girls, or both (over/under-diagnosis is not mutually exclusive), as long as it keeps happening.  This gets much more complicated to summarize, because each disorder is different.  But, for example, over-diagnosis of ADHD in boys harms them because it confirms the sensational theory of days past that we are using chemical restraints to restrict behavioral problems (by medicating as a response behaviors that might, in part, be due to differences in gender expression); this is not true for autism, which has no chemical treatment, but it does still mean we are over-treating behaviors that might be in part because of the way we teach and allow kids to act.  Under-diagnosis of ADHD and autism in girls, meanwhile, harms them because it leads to a denial of the treatments and services those girls need to thrive in employment and independent living.  Either way, I think the way we socialize boys and girls is hurting neurodivergent children, and we, as feminists (and just ethical people in general), need to think about how gendered socialization harms neurodivergent children.

Personally, I think that, more than anything else, girls are under-diagnosed, because the differences in gender socialization lead to boys in general being more behaviorally expressive, and girls less so, and so boys who have behavioral issues are easy to recognize per the “eye test”.  I trust the diagnostic professionals themselves to be able to make a fair and nuanced diagnosis, but not the people who *recommend* them for diagnosis to be able to recognize less obvious cases.  (For this same reason, I believe ADHD - hyperactive type is more easy to recognize than ADHD - inattentive type.)  For this reason, I believe this is an explicitly feminist issue, regardless of how you feel about neurodivergence in general.

What are your thoughts on this?  Do you think that these sex differences in diagnosis are reflective of true sex differences, or unequal outcomes due to socialization?  Either way, what do you believe should be done about it?  Should we change our assessment criteria in order to reflect differences in gender expression?  Change our diagnostic criteria in order to reflect how these disorders manifest differently across gender lines?  Obviously, “not gendering socialization” should help close gender gaps, but how else can we work to fix the problem in the space we’re already in?",AskFeminists,1523047681,rewardadrawer,26,18,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/8acyks/what_do_you_think_is_the_cause_of_sexgender/,2018-04-06

135,"Trophy for ""Best Woman"" in a competition","I recently got into Darts as a competitive sport in Germany. I'm part of a tiny little club, not very good, that mostly consists of white men past 50. I'm by far the youngest there, and the three women we have rarely show up. I'm male. Other clubs (10-20 people each) have 1-3 women.

I generally don't discuss politics or gender issues there, simply because people are either not interested or very polemic (think ""Everything the government does is shit, slap them all""). I'm there for playing Darts, and some of my feminist friends (when I asked them) confirmed it's okay I don't debate people there. As a feminist, I'm a minority there, and I'd make myself vulnerable by offering unsolicited criticism. I realise that's a bit of a cowardly way of doing it, but I don't think I could change anything about their view on the world.

But there's one thing I'm not sure how to feel about, partly because I'm not a woman, and no amount of compassion and empathy can make me fully understand a woman's experience as if it were my own.

In tournaments (not league games, rarer and often open to the public), there are money and trophy rewards for the three or five top-ranking players, regardless of gender. In addition, there's a ""Best Woman"" trophy. If a woman finishes first, she gets money and two trophies. If a woman finishes tenth, she gets a trophy.

Don't get me wrong, this isn't about ""but why is there no best man trophy"". I'm not one of those. And, sadly, most of the time first place equals best man anyway.

I'm not sure how to feel about that trophy, and I think there are two contrasting main arguments to be made.

1) This trophy signals that women are bad at Darts. Let's give at least one of them a consolation prize. They won't win anything any other way.

2) We don't have enough women playing with us. Let's encourage them by rewarding their efforts.

I'm stuck. Which one is it? Does it depend on the intention behind it, or does the mere existence of this trophy already signal a specific intention?

How do you feel about such trophies? Have you encountered something similar? How would you handle this?

136,"As a guy, how can I cope with the fact that men may be worthless?","This isn't an attack on feminism btw. It's just an observation.

Women can basically do everything men can, for starters.

I don't believe in certain generalizations (like how men are inherently violent or women are inherently caring, because those are socially influenced after all). But overall, what is the role of men?

I have hobbies, interests, goals, I'm very ambitious. As person who likes to have a family however, that's where the pain comes in.

I'm not gonna lie, I get jealous of the relationship women have with their babies, breastfeeding, etc. It's a special thing. Babies apparently need skin contact with the mother immediately after birth. The fathers don't really matter in that scenario. I'm not one of those dudes that thinks it's solely the mom's job, either. I wanna have a good relationship with my kids. I just still feel like my job isn't special however. Like I'm replaceable.

I feel like as a guy, my job is to just be a sperm donor and get out. Like once the woman gives birth, I'm not technically not needed. Having a male role model of any type is enough for children, it doesn't even have to be the father. After all, there are couples where 2 women raise their children, with the children not knowing or ever meeting the biological dad, and they're fine.

Even look at matriarchal tribes (like the Musuo tribe in Asia). The men are basically just tools. They impregnate the women, and after that, they aren't needed. Don't even work or live with the family, and yet they grow up fine.

It's demoralizing for me. I feel worthless. I genuinely feel like crying when I think about it, like as if biologically speaking, my life is simply to have a good repertoire so that I can be selected by a woman, and once she's pregnant, I'm not *inherently* needed. I just live on and that's it. I hate the fact that as a guy, a guy who wants to be a supportive husband/partner and a great dad, I'm still *different*. I feel like we as men are just *different*. Like as if women are the real people, and as men we are just here to provide DNA differentiation. We become filler, after the child is born. Yes, it's important to help raise and provide. But there's nothing intrinsically ""male"" or ""biological father"" about that. Again, another woman can do that job. And when you look at how artificial sperm is a thing, it feels bad.

Especially when you look at how men and women aren't all the same. You can't even say that ""men are good protectors cuz their strong, and they have creativity/craftiness and lots of ambition"" and all that because not every man is the same. A lot of women are ambitious too, a lot who lift weight can also reach sufficient strength to do the important stuff men can do. It's a painful thing because I don't even have any animosity towards women at all. I'm not blaming them.

So, overall, as a guy whose views essentially make me a feminist (I support equal opportunity for women, I feel bad for women who are pigeon-holed into certain roles/behavior and can't be who they wanna be, for the women who deal with sexual/physical assault, for the women who have to deal with the men in their lives that never listen to them for even basic things, etc.), how can I cope with this feeling? It genuinely feels bad.

138,My thoughts on the debate between Guy Aoki and Sarah Silverman on “Politically Incorrect”,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsNoO8xMs04

First: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh

I can't believe how entitled Bill Maher acts. As he was criticized in the video, he literally aims to define African Americans, their language, and the social implications related to language use. (And honestly, every song? What does that guy listen to? Those new gospel songs must be something else.)

Like Guy Aoki retorted, there still is a deep seated hatred behind racist words. They have not been properly reappropriated (I am not even sure if they should be tbh), their history and meaning has not been yet rewritten.

Then Sarah Silverman and that whateverthefuck his name is... ""yeah, what's the problem with using historically loaded racial terms... relax bro... comedy is supposed to insult""... like... wtf. Who carved a moral exception for comedy? Am I missing a moral argument here, that allows for punching down on social minorities (in a manner that is consistent with morality (barf))?

My conclusion is: these people should just own that if they do use racist jokes/language, then that is immoral. They should own that they behave in an immoral way (as opposed to *also* claiming the moral high ground, that they did nothing wrong; yeah, you did it, nobody arrests you for it - but you do have to acknowledge what you did). No, you did do something wrong, wtf is with the doublethink.

141,I don't think the concept of patriarchy is useful when trying to discuss society's problems and their solutions,"To me, it feels like most feminists blame the patriarchy for every societal issue there is. Women are underrepresented in politics? Patriarchy. Men are more likely to be homeless and commit suicide? Patriarchy. Trump became president despite being a misogynistic asshole? Patriarchy. Instead of just lazily resorting to the concept of patriarchy as an explanation for everything, we should realise that various issues can (and do) have different causes and possible solutions. I think doing this would make coming up with solutions more effective.

Society's expectations, gender roles, and biological differences means that men and women are privileged and disadvantaged in different, complex ways. An example: Men generally take the more dangerous jobs such as in construction or enrolling in the army, while women are overrepresented in nursing and such jobs. Trying to explain this phenomenon with the concept of patriarchy doesn't make much sense.

In my opinion, in combating issues such as women being raped or the male suicide rate we need to look at the issues individually instead of trying to dismantle the elusive patriarchy.

2,"When is ""culture"" or ""tradition"" (same thing really) a justifiable defense for blatant acts of sexism including very obviously sexist legislation?","Feminists are often told to back off because ""not everyone is white and entitled and judgemental"".

Ok first off, I'm *not white* and second off, I don't agree that culture of any kind is defenseable when it comes to sexism - this is not including religiously driven sexism, which is even worse.

Everyone's ""culture"" comes from somewhere - so when you say ""no we have to do it this way because culture / tradition"", what you're really saying is that we have to do it the way our concurrers / influencers did when they first got here.

Everyone remembers ""white"" imperialism because it's modern and easy to identify. Does nobody remember the Persian conquest of the Indian subcontinent? Chinese cultural influence over Japan, Korea, Vietnam, etc...

What exactly is culture / tradition? And who the eff are you trying to imitate? Because majority of your culture that you follow today probably isn't indigenous at all.

22,Do you believe all men (at least all straight men) are inherently sexist?,"I was listening to a podcast about a show called Survivor that I watch that I actually really enjoy. It’s hosted by four straight cis men and they began to discuss about a tribe of men who were talking so much smack about the other tribe (a tribe of women). The underlying tone of the smack talk was we’re going to beat them because they’re women and we’re men and there is no way those girls will be able to survive on their own because they’re female..  One of the hosts responds “well that’s just the way men talk when they’re not around women! Men are only respectful to women when they want to impress or get with them” or some shit like that. It got me thinking if all men (or at least all straight men) are just sexist by nature. Think about it. From birth most of them begin to believe  that masculinity is good and strong and that femininity is bad and weak. They’re taught that the WORST thing a boy could be is effeminate and it leads to bullying other boys when they don’t fit into that masculine stereotype in any way.  Little boys are humiliated when they lose to a girl in any competition regardless of if it’s physical mental or whatever because they have the idea that they’re supposed to be the superior sex. As children most are not told to respect other girls but instead to view them as inferior humans who have “cooties” and should be avoided (until they are older when they’re taught that sleeping with the most women makes them the most “manly” and the only thing you should value a woman on is her body)

This extends into adulthood. The reason why so many straight men are homophobic towards gay men is because they believe that being sexually attracted to men  and sleeping with them  is a feminine thing and that gay men are giving up their “man card”. Meanwhile lesbians are completely fine by them because they feed into their fetishes. Most crimes against transgender women come from cis straight men for the exact same reason. Plus a lot of men will pretend to care about womens issues if it’s gets them an opportunity to get the girl. 

I’m not saying that all straight men are sexist as they can be taught not to be. But the assumption that all  men are inherently sexist does not seem that far off. That’s just my opinion however.

25,How can the line between sexual objectification and sexual empowerment be drawn?,"Basically, you have women that take sexy/nude pictures of themselves - usually cause they like the way they look (and because of the general conditioning of having women's bodies deemed artful by default). Some also open premium snap accounts and charge money to show off pictures. Some say it's empowering (because it's generally difficult for women to feel good about their looks since so much importance is placed on female beauty in this patriarchal society). Some also say it's empowering because they're turning a traditionally male initiated act into their own (i.e. they ""owning"" the action, they are ""owning"" their bodies). All of that makes perfect sense.

The thing is though is that doesn't it still sometimes contribute to objectification as a whole? In the sense that, although the *intent* behind the pictures/photos isn't to objectify, ***the end result (the photo itself) still ends up resembling*** a long line of objectifying, male-gaze-ish pictures? For example, the following is a picture of a pornstar (sort of NSFW: https://i.pinimg.com/736x/71/21/79/7121791e9b1952176f2e50f86d47df5a--sexy-star-melina.jpg). And this the page of an instagram model (scroll down to see some pictures: https://www.instagram.com/barbielynnstardoll/)

Again, obviously the model is taking it **herself**: she has **agency**. But in the end, **the people viewing the pictures - including both impressionable young boys and girls** - aren't gonna see that. They're simply going to see sexualized photos of women. And those instances, generally what will happen is that the idea of women's bodies being sex objects/solely sexual gets reinforced in the boys head - hence why most depictions of or suggestions of women's bodies can titillate them. while the girls may look at them and that their bodies aren't good enough, which is unfortunate. I feel like it also puts pressure on girls too, in the sense that it encourages them to *have* to adopt a more sexualized appearance, at the risk of feeling inadequate (some similar sentiments are expressed in this article I read (https://www.themarysue.com/kim-kardashian-send-nudes/)).

In essence, it creates a feedback, loop, a blob. Where women feel like they have to fall in line, and where men are groomed to objectify women, thus repeating the cycle.


I'm not saying that those women *shouldn't* post photos. **It's not my place as a guy to tell women what to do. ** More importantly, women's bodies should be able to be set free from being tied to sex. So please don't get the wrong idea. Their bodies should be viewed like men's bodies - neutral. In fact, I find it unfortunate how men are able to have sexy six pack photos and still be taken seriously, while women who to take sexy photos are looked at in a diminished light. I'm wondering how this whole issue can be rectified.

26,Which is better for the feminism movement - Revolution or Reformation?,"I know this is an age old question and probably covered already on this sub (I'm new) but it's something I've been wrestling with in relation to the #metoo movement. 
 
On one hand you have the revolutionary feminists who want radical change and social upheaval, tearing down systems in society that oppress women. And they typically bring with them a ""you're either with us or against us"" approach to their activism. We've seen this in the way accused men and even friends of accused men have been publicly shamed without due process because those feminists believe the justice system right now is inherently flawed and patriarchal.


On the other hand you have reformers like the Margaret Atwood types who want change, not by tearing down those systems but by fixing the system from within. Atwood acknowledges that the legal system is broken for women but doesn't think the solution is to do away with the system altogether or to ignore important parts of it like due process. But this approach only demands small incremental change and doesn't really disrupt the status quo. 

So I'm torn about how to feel about this as I'm sympathetic to both positions. Interested in where others stand.

31,Feminism in an all boys school,"[New account in the interests of keeping my work and private lives separate].

I'm a teacher at an all boys school. A colleague of mine (a woman) recently gave a talk to a group of the boys on the issue of representation in Hollywood. The focus was specifically on women and ethnic minorities and the ways in which both groups have historically been marginalised within the industry and the continuing impact this has in terms of their representation. It was thought-provoking and full of pretty damning facts and statistics, but was also very far from being polemical or aggressive. In other words, it was a pretty gentle introduction to the topic.

The reaction of the majority of the boys was, as far as I was concerned, really worrying. There was rudeness directed at the teacher and the general consensus amongst them could be boiled down to one of the questions that was asked afterwards: ""but why should there be equality anyway?"" 

These are boys aged around 14-16 from wealthy backgrounds who have grown up in a very cosmopolitan environment.

We have had an external group come in and do workshops on masculinity and the ways in which it might be re-defined and there are lots of young, bright, feminist female teachers on the staff, but the views nevertheless seem quite entrenched.

Has anyone here encountered anything similar or heard about it being tackled effectively? Also, are there any other subreddits I could x-post this to which might provide useful feedback?

Thanks!

TL;DR: I believe lots of the boys at the school I teach hold quite worrying views about women and am looking for suggestions for how this could be addressed and challenged.

In my understanding of feminist discourse,  which may be out of date, ""feminism helps men too"" does not mean that feminism is about MENs rights issues as described BY men or mens complaints, but is a statement meant to convey that fighting for the rights of WOMEN, the interests of women and the patriarchal system helps men TOO  in the way FEMINISM believes men need help.  That feminism is not concerned about the manner in which gaining womens rights and advocating for womens issues ""harms"" mens interests,  in the sense these men keep throwing at me

My understanding of ""feminism is about equality"" is that it's a glib expression of the broader statement that the mission of feminism is to rectify legal inequities and social isabilities that WOMEN suffer vis a vis MEN or in the patriarchal system,  NOT that it's mission includes rectifying any male-perceived inequities and social disabilities that men suffer vis a vis women that MEN consider such 

Am I off base in my understanding? Is what I just wrote clear and accurate?  I keep trying to explain that feminism is about WOMENS issues,  not mens,  and these facile quotes that are coming from the mouths of self proclaimed feminists keep being thrown back at me.

50,Why do we need feminism?,"Prelude: This may be a recurring topic, but a more detailed wording/explanation of my questions about feminism are below, so please do not remove this post. 

This is a broad question, I know, but I ask for the simple reason that I have yet to hear a good answer. Most answers follow the pattern of ""there are X social issues about women or the female gender role"", but there are social issues for men too, so feminism becomes redefined to include men and women, but then that begs the question why we call it feminism, and my original question would stand. Furthermore, I would assert that ""institutional"" issues are not prevalent in our society. I cannot think of any sexist institutions. Also, some ""institutional"" issues tend to be able to be broken down to the faults of individuals (for example, Trump making a sexist remark doesn't make our government sexist, it isn't like he is calling for sexist policy that I know of). 

So the reason I lay all of that out is because there are 2 things that would convince me why we need feminism, and I think any open-minded conservative or non-feminist would feel the same:

1. Evidence that there exists sexist institutions. (Names of specific institutions, and evidence of their discrimination against women).

2. An explanation of why societal issues warrant feminism. (This probably requires a sub-explanation of why women's issues are more concerning than men's issues, OR a sub-explanation of why a movement encompassing both men and women is called ""feminism"").

3. Something I have overlooked.

54,Is monogamy inherently problematic?,"(The following few paragraphs provide context as to why I'm asking this question. Feel free to skip them if you think they're unnecessary. The question is in the title and in the last, bold paragraph.)

Disclaimer: I'm male, I'm bisexual, and I've only recently (a year or two) been drawn to feminism after a few years of being uneducated on the matter and, frankly, not caring. I call myself a feminist because I agree with feminism's core theories and because I actively try educating those around me on feminist matters - if they're willing. Still, I've got a lot to learn, and this sub has been tremendously helpful so far.

From what I can see around here and from talking to other feminists, it seems many feminists are critical of monogamy. I've heard arguments about problematic power structures between men and women in heterosexual monogamous relationships and about the concept of ""owning"" your partner or ""forbidding"" them from realising their sexual/romantic ""freedom.""

I personally think that polyamory, friends with benefits, open relationships and the like are not for me. I've listened to other opinions, contemplated on the matter, and I still believe that a monogamous relationship is the only right thing for me personally. As far as I can identify my own motivations, fears and reasons, I don't believe it's because I yearn for power over someone or want to ""own"" someone. The fact that I'm attracted to cis and trans men and women as well as non-conforming and non-binary people doesn't change that. I believe that I can be satisfied romantically and sexually in a relationship with one person, even though one person can't possibly ""be"" all the various genders I'm attracted to at once.

But I'm aware of the possibility that I'm kidding myself and that it's all just my upbringing and society's influence. I'm trying to keep an open mind, as in all matters.

60,8% of Mechanical Engineers are Women,"Hi all,

I stumbled upon some startling statistics [here] (https://ngcproject.org/statistics), and I was wondering what you think the cause behind the disproportionate involvement of women in STEM was.

At first, I figured that it was the result of the pressure women experience to prove themselves in the STEM field, and that perhaps the subconscious bias of the male majority drove many women away from the field.

And while I think this certainly has an impact, when I look at other countries like Sweden, Finland, or Norway, I find that female involvement in engineering is unfortunately just as low, with the highest involvement at 30% being in Greece and Portugal ([source](https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/artikler-og-publikasjoner/norway-world-leader-in-gender-equality)).

These listed countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland) are often regarded as some of the most egalitarian places in the world. And yet, the disparity in STEM still remains.

Is this the result of an inherent difference in the things that interest men and women? Of course, I am speaking generally here.

63,Is feminism really about gender equality?,"I want to start by saying that I consider myself to be a feminist. This is a question about how feminism is framed.

Is feminism about the empowerment of women in order to achieve equal rights (analogous to ""black rights"")?

Or is feminism about anti-sexism in general (analogous to ""racial equality"")?

In my experience, feminism tends to be more similar to the former definition, but tends to try to spin itself as more like the latter.

Most people (feminist or otherwise) recognize that both men and women suffer from sexism. I think a common sentiment among feminists is that ""feminism"" covers both men's issues and women's issues. But in my experience, in practice, feminist spaces focus almost exclusively on women's issues.

I think this has the potential to alienate men. It seems dishonest to say that feminism is about men and women, and it sends the message that discussion of men's issues is anti-feminist.

64,Works about externalities linked to feminism.,"Do you know any works done by feminists or at least neutral people about good and bad externalities due to social changes supported by Feminism ?

Usually, feminists mostly speak of good externalities like a government would do. And anti feminists only speak of the bad ones like the opposition to a government often do.

For examples, one of the concern I am interested in, is the claim that Feminism may not be economically sustanaible, because of the alteration of the family unit.

The root of their concerns is that in aggregate there is a net transfer of wealth from men to women via the State.
And that with the end of socially enforced marriage as only way to sex (and marriage law to a lesser extent), new entertainment technologies, men will gradually loose the will and the need to work as hard as they did in the past.
So they fear, that it would lead to reduced taxes, slower innovation, ect ...

Another example of subject I'm interested in, would be the likeliness of different societal cultures to survive and their speed of technological progresses.
It may suck to be an individual at a fixed time in a Patriarchal system. But if more wealth, more technologies are produced, it could be better for individuals three generation later, than for a more hedonist society.

I'm interested about theoritical works or studies, not having a debate here. You may cite works about any externalities you think are worthy. 

I'm clearly aware that their are factors others than Feminism. Technology is a really important factor, because it is hard to implement Feminism in a society that survives precisely because women are having 7+ children in their lifetime.

65,What's the contribution of organized feminism to the #MeToo movement?,"Hi everyone, I'm kind of an outsider, or a fence-sitter, when it comes to many social justice movements. However, the recent success of the #MeToo movement has decisively pushed me over the edge: I think the campaign has a real shot at shifting social norms for the better in a lasting way. The people behind #MeToo have accomplished something incredibly valuable, and I can no longer retreat to positions like ""sure feminism makes sense in theory, but in practice it just badgers people to no good effect."" (That kind of thought was never my primary position, but it was certainly in the mix.) 

I wonder if anyone in this sub knows more about the influence organized feminism has on the #MeToo movement. By ""organized feminism"", I mean the kind of thought coming out of feminist journalism and books and the kind of discussion you all have here. I'm contrasting it with #MeToo itself, which I might call ""de-centralized feminism,"" given that it lives on social media  which is (I think) inherently less hierarchical.

69,Are nonbinary genders problematic for movements interested in equality?,"I have friends who have asked me to refer to their pronouns as they/them. I did so,  even though it grated on me because I was ashamed that it grated on me. I have always considered myself very open minded and all inclusive.

Then after soul searching I discovered why I thought I took issue with nonbinary genders and when I sought to discuss this with my nonbinary friend,  they were at once shaming and sought only to shut me up and shut me down. 

Which felt eerily close to what the patriarchy has done when I have sought to explain my womanhood.

I consider my womanhood to be synonomous with personhood. The two are interchangeable.  

Which means my womanhood can be and is whatever my mind can conceive of. Telling me it can't mean that or that my womanhood has any limits at all is the patriarchy's bread and butter. By the way, my womanhood has in the past meant that I bind my tits and hide my hips while I enjoyed raunchy, glorious, and complete masculinity, while never detaching from my snatch. My womanhood has also meant that I feel like neither gender. And I have detached from my womanly form. Sometimes its been scary and sometimes its something else,  something ethereal maybe.  Otherworldly,  extra strange, yes, but all this is a human feeling and I attribute it to a deeper layer of my personhood,  my womanhood, because I do not limit myself or all that I can be. A tiny little pronoun could never encapsulate me! I dont expect anyone to fit into a box and I think its harmful to take a viewpoint that forces others into boxes, so that you yourself can be boxless. 

I think it might also be offensive towards actual transgendered people,  who do not have a choice and cannot identify with their birth pronoun and genetalia.  I can't begin to imagine what that is like,  but I also don't think its right for me to be offended on behalf of anyone but it does prickle my sense of justice in numerous ways.

These are my thoughts.

How can nonbinary genders exist without putting definitions onto what it is to be a man or woman?

When I think about it more, hentai clearly isn't what I usually have in mind when I use words like erotic art. Hentai is very explicit and features the same hardcore sex that's in pornography. I'm skeptical that this is good for society or that it really serves enough of a purpose to continue. So I'm no longer sure that I should treat it as differently to pornography.

86,What is meant when it is said that all sexual misconduct accusers should be believed?,"I've been hearing this a lot more lately with #metoo garnering a lot of attention, but it's been around for a while.

The reason I ask this is that I am very wary of the idea that accusers should be believed by default.  I am an attorney and I have (although not in my current practice) represented accused criminals in court.  By far, most people who are put on trial for crimes are guilty, but some are not.  I have personally seen this concept (years before #metoo and Harvey Weinstein), that women should always be believed when they accuse a boy of sexual misconduct, have ruinous consequences for innocent people.  It is an awful feeling to listen to your client and look at the evidence arrayed against them and realize that they really are innocent.  It is even worse when so many of their peers won't listen and so few will hear her cross examination.  And then to hear that people want to further limit cross examinations of accusers.

To be fair, my client was acquitted, but the State put forward a serious case to lock him away.  Our justice system often relies on the State doing their due diligence, which they did not do in part, I believe, because they did not doubt the accuser.  Surely, this is not the world that feminists are hoping for, is it?

What is meant by the idea that accusers of sexual misconduct should be believed?

87,Why is feminism so opposed to the concept of the friend zone?,"Two reasons here.

1. Friendzoning  is not just a ""female-male"" thing. Men can friendzone women, men can friendzone men, women can friendzone women, non-binary people can friendzone non-binary people. It's more of a human thing. 

2. Rejection  freaking HURTS. Especially when you have extremely low self-esteem. I always think that feminists who make fun of men in the friendzone are extremely outgoing and good-looking and not socially awkward and have never been bullied  or have never had to experience rejection from a person that they like in their entire life because if they did they would understand the pain. Humans are designed to want to have satisfying romantic  and sexual relationships  regardless of gender or sexuality( with the exception of asexual/aromantic folks ) and not achieving that can make you feel  depressed, worthless, unwanted and unloved. I spent YEARS hating myself because I thought I was too ugly and socially awkward to ever be in a relationship. I was constantly bullied for being ugly when I was younger. Then I fell in love with someone who made me feel like I was actually wanted and loved. It was great. He flirted with me and kissed me and everything but then one day he broke it to me that he was never interested in me and that he was just experimenting  because ""didn't know what he wanted."" But he still wanted to be friends.  Oh man if you think I hated myself before I began to LOATHE myself afterwards and it drove me to attempt suicide. It was like everything those bullies ever said about me being ugly was true.

88,"Feminists from Scandinavia and less gender equal countries, what's your take on the ""Gender equality paradox""?","This theory has been around for a while, I think I first heard about it from a Norwegian documentary ""Brainwashing"". But it seems like not long ago there was a new study on this, or otherwise this idea resurfaced and hit a trend, but lately I've been seeing a lot of reference to this.

So apparently there was a study showing that, contrary to popular belief, ""more gender-equal countries"" had less gender equality in workplace than ""less gender-equal countries"". I'm not sure what exactly their markers for ""gender equality"" were, since in some cases that can be subjective, and result depend on what exactly they were measuring, but Scandinavian countries are usually considered the most gender equal in the world, basically the current standard for gender equality, yet it turned out they have the lowest percent of female engineers, and the lowest percent of male nurses. Those are the only two jobs I see mentioned in relation to that study, so I'm not sure about others. Meanwhile, countries like Iran that are definitely far from gender-equal have an astonishingly high number of female engineering and computer science students, they make the actual majority.

Needless to say, this ""Gender equality paradox"" theory is constantly used by biological determinists to claim that men and women are inherently completely different. The explanation (stated by the authors of that study as well) is that in more gender equal countries women have more freedom of choice, so they have more option to choose what they're inherently interested in (""traditionally feminine"" jobs), while women in less gender equal countries are often forced into jobs they don't like just to get out of poverty.

I find this phenomenon very curious, and maybe there could be some truth in it, but I'm not entirely sold. I can see many potential flaws. The official explanation is just one of the many possible ones I can think of. Nobody seems to consider potential cultural differences among those countries, that could be relevant.

So I've been trying to find more information, but what I find frustrating is that most people discussing it are Americans, or from other Anglosphere countries. I've yet to see any people from those studied countries weigh in on this, and it's so absurd that nobody seems to be asking their opinion, because obviously people from those countries are much better informed about the level of gender equality and gender roles there. At the very least, why has nobody, for example, interviewed those Iranian female engineering students and asked them why they're studying engineering, so that we could get some actual answers and not just guesses and assumptions from people who've never even lived in those countries?

I know most Redditors are from the US, but are there any people here from Scandinavian countries and those less gender-equal countries as defined by that study? Anybody from Indian, Middle Eastern countries, somewhere else? I'm really curious to hear your opinion on this so-called ""Gender equality paradox"".

93,How do I protect my friend who is being creep shamed and bullied by my feminist friend?,"Okay, for starters let me first say, if a woman does not want to have a relationship with some1 that is her choice, also I am not a basement dwelling virgin who just sees women as holes,

So, please keep the responses civil.

Done? Good, so here's the scenario.

A very pretty girl in my group is very social and generally admired by all of the people in the class.

She is always smiling and is well liked by every1.

However this girl has made 2 very poor choices when it comes to men, where the 2 blokes have just strung her alog for sex and dumped her.

The second bloke still has her on his beck and call and she easily responds to him

Recently I Saw her befriend a shy loner type guy who was bullied as a kid and normally keeps to himself. This girl was now suddenly always seen in his company and always dragged him along with her. It was also obvious to me that the guy was smitten with the interest this girl was showing in him and really liked her more than a friend.

Then suddenly after a few weeks, I see this girl upset and ask another one of her mutual friends as to whats wrong and then she told me that apparently, the loner guy was a creep who just wanted to have sex with the girl.

Now, I happened to have spoken to this bloke a few times and though did not know him well, I knew that he would never even hurt a fly.

Just like that, he had been ostracised by our entire group.

I, however, went up to him and asked him what was wrong,

What happens next is what shocked me.

Initially, this guy was hesitant to even talk to me and asked me to leave him alone, he even said it was no use and his reputation was in taters anyways, I told him not to worry about it and took the bloke to a quiet place, sat him down and he explained his side.


So, the girl apparently had started stringing conversations with him and within a few weeks had started sharing all her thoughts with him ( bear in mind not with her friends who she knew for months, but the new guy whom she befriended 2 weeks ago)


Then the guy seem to have lost for words and I prodded asking him if he fell for this girl

He still looked down and said he wanted to go out with her and had asked her out for a date.

Then apparently the girl had flatly told him no and was surprised as she just saw him as a friend.

The guy was surprised but accepted her choice and felt that he wanted to invest more time in himself and wanted to work for the betterment in himself ( gym, social life ) and hence would not be able to devote the same time.


At this point his voice quivered and I had to calm him down and he told me that the girl then lost it,

She started yelling at him and shouting telling him that he was a creep who just wanted to use her ( me thinks she is taking out the anger of her poor choices on this guy ) and that she would warn all  the female friends in our group to keep away from him, if he did listen to all her problems and continue being her friends.

It took me all my strength to remain calm here.

I went ahead and spoke to the girl and for the very first time saw a side to her that I hadnt seen before.

Gone was the sweet voice, the friendly   tone.

She told flatly that the guy was an abuser and deserves to be alienated and unless he apologized and showed a change in his behaviour ( read follow all my whims and fancies ) he had no right to be near her friends and it was her duty to protect her friends.

Since that day, the guy has been harassed and just keeps his head down in class.

I went ahead and told  his side to ur group but all of them were convinced with the girls story and are not even willing to listen

Remember this girl is pretty and by pretty I don't mean bi boobs blonde cheerleader pretty, I mean the Hollywood specs wearing pretty.

While I have managed to isolate myself from the group and keep a hold of that guy intorducing to my new social circle, I SEEM to have incurred the wrath of the girl as well

Her quote : if he's so madly in love with me, I would understand but he does not even say that.

I told her that he was never in love her, that he never intended to sleep with her and now wants to work on himself.

94,Wondering if I could get some input on how to view a potential assault case,"So I've learned a long time ago that I'm not an expert on feminism, and it's often better to ask questions than to make assumptions. In the spirit of this, I would love some input on some drama I've witnessed in my community. As it regards a student I have never personally met, I am not 100% on details, and cannot really comment on the character of accuser or accused, and am only representing the story as common gossip tells it.

Basically, a student has accused another student of assault, by means of posting photos around campus with the accused's face, calling him a rapist. I've been pretty sickened by men complaining about false rape accusations, as I know the false report rate is tiny. That being said, I'm left with mixed feelings on this matter. Is it appropriate to disseminate photos like this? The assault is supposed to have occurred several years ago, and no report was filed with the school, as far as I know. I tend to lean towards believing the woman, but it feels pretty mob-justice-y. 

Basically, I've been left feeling conflicted and am curious if this is something the community has any thoughts on?

96,Goy-splaining: have you engaged in it?,"For those that haven't watched Seinfeld, *goy* is a Yiddish term for gentile. A non-Jew. 

The first time I heard this term it was on Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. She used it to describe how John Kasich was explaining the involvement of Jesus Christ in Passover... to a group of orthodox Jews. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a joke on her show, and that's saying something.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0juEWMksOw

Why did I laugh so hard? Because it hurt. I knew exactly what goy-splaining was even though I never heard the term before. How? Because I experience it all the time on the feminist and progressive websites that I frequent.

It hurts to feel marginalized like that and have my experiences dismissed and invalidated. Especially among those that are fighting bigotry and claim that we should not do to others the very thing that they are doing to Jews.

When Jews point out that there is anti-Semitism among the left, we're  dismissed. Of course, there are numerous declarations that anti-Semitism is *bad* just like all forms of bigotry are *bad*. But those statements don't have much meaning if they are made by people that are unwilling to identify anti-Semitism as such.

When Jews point out anti-Semitism among feminists, progressives, etc, we are told that we are paranoid, that we are confusing it with criticism of Israel, that it's like the boy who cried wolf, and that we are overusing the term. This, we are told, undermines *real* anti-Semitism when it happens because we won't be taken seriously. (by *real* anti-Semitism, they mean anti-Semitism coming from right-wingers)

I don't want to get into the details now, the post would be too long. However, I do want to point out just how hypocritical this is.

It goes against the very principles of intersectionality and privilege. Why?

Because these same champions of intersectionality will tell white people to shut up and listen when POCs and LGBTQ folk discuss the racism and bigotry that they face. We are told to be quiet and pay attention when hashtags like solidarityisforwhitewomen pop up so that we can learn from the experiences of WOCs and adapt.

Jews are treated differently by feminists and progressives. We are not afforded the same respect or the same platform to discuss the anti-Semitism that we experience, unless it comes from the right-wing.

It's a travesty what happened with the UK labor party. Overrun by anti-Semitism, it's a party that once had the vast majority of the Jewish vote in the UK is now only getting 13%.

 https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/labour-antisemitism-jews-jeremy-corbyn

The BLM movement has ostracized Jews that would have been happy to support it otherwise. 

https://forward.com/opinion/346865/black-lives-matter-lost-me-with-that-israel-bashing-platform/

Last year we had already seen anti-Semitism in the leaders of the women's march before the scandal with Farrakhan.

https://forward.com/scribe/371071/anti-semitism-in-the-feminist-movement-is-nothing-new/

Jews were told to leave LGBT parades.

http://www.newsweek.com/gay-pride-marchers-jewish-flags-told-leave-chicago-parade-628879

http://time.com/4839592/anti-semitism-lgbtq-pride/

So my question is not why there is goy-splaining going on by progressives and feminists, that's a complicated discussion for another time. I don't want to debate these articles.

My question is, when you see Jews raise issues and express concerns about anti-Semitism in people, groups and organizations that you otherwise support, do you dismiss their concerns? Do you goy-splain to Jews that what they think is anti-Semitic isn't really anti-semitism? 

When you read those articles, do you dismiss their perspective? Do disagree that they are calling out anti-Semitism?

Thank you and have a nice weekend.

Edit: Another reason I love Samantha Bee so much, she's the only non-Jewish progressive that I know to publicly call out anti-Semitism on the left. 

&gt;Surveying this scene, TBS comedian Samantha Bee aired footage of an anti-Semite ranting at a Trump rally, then cracked, “To find anti-Semitism that rabid, you’d have to go to, well, any left-leaning American college campus.” 

This is taken from a great article which I will also cite.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-anti-semitism/2017/02/03/a8de59e2-e884-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html?utm_term=.11c533c3d88e

And I'll leave everyone with another quote which I hope will provide some food for thought:

&gt;This bipartisan bigotry shouldn’t surprise. Anti-Semitism could never have attained its impressive influence without forging coalitions across ideological and religious lines. Hatred of Jews has long thrived on its ability to ensnare utterly opposite worldviews. Thus, the 2013 E.U. survey found that Italian and Swedish Jews perceived more anti-Semitic statements coming from the left, Hungarian Jews heard them overwhelmingly from Christians and the right, and French Jews reported abuse largely from Muslim extremists. It’s tempting to cast anti-Semitism as the sin of other people, but that’s usually a way to avoid confronting the problem within one’s own community.

105,Is it possible to separate gender roles from genders?,"This strikes me as something that someone might have theorized about. I think more often in modern culture women are adopting characteristics that have traditionally been considered ""male"", and I'm wondering if there's a way we could bundle up the concepts that humans had connected with femininity and just remove any expectation that particular people should play those roles. The same of course goes for masculinity.

For background, I'm a male from north america. My perception of traditional feminine qualities are quiet and emotion-centered and polite, where masculine qualities are more assertive and louder and more physically strong. I started noticing how that plays out in my life and I started experimenting with playing the different roles at different times.

I recognize that these roles are changing, and honestly that's fairly much to my dismay. It strikes me that we don't want gender roles to change-- we want them to stop affecting how we behave. I think it's good for some people to be a ""strong independent woman who don't need no man"", but I don't think that will work for all women, and we shouldn't expect it to, and on top of that, I know plenty of men who could use some empowering in this particular department.

I'm not decided on thinking that traditional gender roles should continue to exist at all, but I still wonder if we could continue to have these concepts of strength vs. tenderness, but without expecting that people perform one constantly.

I hope this makes sense and isn't too rambly. The main question is if there exists some effort to leave the parts that make up gender roles intact except to extract any expectation that a particular gender should play a particular role. Any information regarding such an effort is much appreciated!

UPDATE: as I wrote this it occurred to me that Yin and Yang seem like a similar thing that one could easily consider separately from gender (if one is able to ignore mentions of Yin as female and Yang as male). This sort of thing-- to be able to write gender out of this nice concept of contrast, but in the western context, is what I'm looking for. If only it were so neatly bundled without having been termed ""gender roles"" then we might more easily be able to separate these tenancies from any expectation that people live them.

UPDATE 2: WTF kind of term is ""gender roles""??!!?!

I'm not gonna say ""as a woman"" because i don't need to fake that i'm a woman so my point about sexism against men in court actually gets considered as non-biased. There is nothing biased about saying that if this was a man doing this to a woman, or even another man, he would've been lucky to have just a few years in prison.

Violence and domestic abuse against men isn't considered a crime. There is nothing stopping women from stabbing men or hurting them any way they can. Hence [this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4187912/Secret-Facebook-Bad-Girls-Advice-brags-domestic-violence.html) .
Men are being failed be courts, the only thing that should bring justice. And the old ""prisons were made for men not for women, it works worse for women that's not fair"" is a bullshit argument. If prisons aren't made for women, make another form of punishment that is just as serious as several years in prison. No punishment is a no punishment. Women always talk about how dangerous it is living as a woman (which is true) but at least there is something preventing bad people who mean you harm from actually harming you.

109,Have I got the gist of feminism?,"I would say I lean towards feminism without being sure how to articulate it. Maybe as a male, I have never really given feminism much thought before, although I should. I am not sure how to articulate this but here is my attempt. I could be completely wrong about something but I'm open to being corrected.

In developing and non-Western countries there is inarguable oppression against women. In the West, arguments in favour of feminism look particularly at the unequal representation of women in legislatures and as heads of state, and disparities of income - more women are working class and single parents than men, so are more affected by economic issues. There are 'luxury' taxes on menstrual items in the EU and in some US states. I think Canada abolished it a few years ago. Contraceptive/abortion rights in the first world are also attacked especially in the USA, Chile, Ireland and others. 

Some arguments against feminism seem to bark up a wrong tree, attacking feminism as if its confined to a bizarre 'SJW' minority on the internet. I disregard those, most of those skirmishes only exist online it seems. Unfortunately in the 2010s I think it has falsely made feminism appear as radical and unreasonable or as something anti-free-speech. As a young teenager a few years ago I would sit on the internet a lot and largely accepted this.

Other common 'real life' arguments against feminism I hear are often statistics such as higher male suicide rates, the fact that 'so do men' also have to live up to unattainable standards of masculinity, and disparities in matrimony and child support.

I have never really thought about it myself but here is what I'm thinking. These issues which I'd say do negatively affect men as well as women are all rooted in arbitrary gender roles. Like male doctors and female nurses.

These gender roles in our culture are subconscious can be generalized as follows: the male plays a dominant role, and must live up to masculine standards. The female plays a submissive role and must live up to feminine standards. They have worn away over the past century but still exist.

So these negative issues affecting men are the result of toxic masculinity gender roles, just like the negative issues affecting women are the result of toxic femininity gender roles. Here's an example: male suicide rates are higher because we are discouraged to show a sensitive side and discuss our mental health, it's all about 'being a man' and taking on the power role. This gender role can make men feel inadequate and does lead to a higher suicide rate. Women: you have to read the FeMail category of the Daily Mail about pink things. Just be 1/5th of the US Senate and any female politicians will be hailed as a victory even if they do little for women or the working poor (Clinton). (I really don't like Hillary Clinton, would have been better than Trump but it's no surprise she lost).

So the overall goal of feminism is to challenge these arbitrary gender roles and that women can take the leadership too, and feminism is actually beneficial for men against these issues mainly affecting men because it also says femininity is okay too, so it's about detaching toxic gender roles from permeating the subconscious of these two genders. Sadly, that message which is perfectly reasonable isn't really gotten out there.

119,"Is it ok for women to use the men's restroom in a public space, e.g. a bar?","Tonight I was celebrating St. Patrick's day with three friends (one guy and two gals). The bar was crowded, the women's restroom had a line of 5-10 people, and the men's restroom was modestly busy but had no line, with guys going in and out maybe a few times per minute. Both the men's and women's restrooms appeared to have a handful of stalls. One of my (female) friends returned to the group after going to the bathroom and was shocked that she ""created a scene"" by using the men's restroom. I asked her why she thought it was ok, and she said she always uses the men's restroom if there's too long of a line for the women's room. I told her that I didn't think that was ok and she shouldn't be shocked for making a scene, because I would be seen as deeply inconsiderate, or possibly even a predator, for using the women's restroom.

Is this a common belief among women, that it's ok to use the men's room in a time of need? Is this possibly a small example of ""female privilege?""

I read a lot of books on the subjects including all of the basic literature on feminism by simon de beauvoir, judith butler etc. (and also studied them at university in my philosophy and social science classes) but also a lot of books, lectures etc. from critics of the feminist movement. Only recently have I also come across the much less organized and much smaller movement regarding mens rights. 

I noticed that there is a lot of tension between the two movements. I wonder why there isn‘t more cooperation yet, because I think if those movements would support eachother, work together, share their networks and all question some of their assumptions and make a few steps in eachothers directions it would be a great progress for society that would result in a lot of benefits for everyone. 

Now my question is if you (as representatives of the feminist movement) have any idea of how such a future could look like and what steps could be to taken to get there in case it is disiarable in your opinion.

Trying to improve myself, so I have some questions.","Bit of background about me - I watch a lot of feminist content (Claudia Brown, Contrapoints, Shaun, hbomb, etc) but I don't feel like I'm a good feminist advocate because I just doubt myself as a person and question the things I do on a daily basis.

1. What are some things well-meaning men commonly do which could be problematic or seen as a microaggression?

2. Is there anything wrong with me having women as my desktop background? Particularly, [this picture of Sombra from Overwatch](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/a4Ak8). My housemate (who is a woman I've known for 4 years now) says there's no issue. But I wanted to hear a feminist perspective. Is there a line? If so, when is it crossed? I just like the way women look and act. Is there a problem with that? If there's a problem with me simply liking the way women look and act then what are some steps I can take to resolve this?

3. How do I advocate for women's rights without looking like a beta/white knight/nice guy/desperate etc?

4. Here in Australia, what are some things I can do to help?

5. I never cat call or perv, but it is extremely common for me to look at a woman and think ""Wow's she's really beautiful/hot/amazing"", especially with women with undercuts, or a bit of muscle, or science majors, or musical instruments. But then I question myself after having such thoughts because I worry that doing so may be some form of objectification that I need to be somehow suppressing. And maybe it's shallow to have a preference for women with particular haircuts, muscles, hobbies, or interests. And I beat myself up about it because I don't know what the ""correct"" way of thinking is. Am I a bad person? Can I be less bad?

Thank you for taking the time to read this :)

Bonus Question:
A lot of the feminists I watch (ContraPoints, Shaun, etc) say they disagree with some of what Anita Sarkeesian says, but they never give examples. What is the problem with Anita?

I think we can all identify that we're probably better people than we were 10 years ago, and I'm being confronted with that pretty intensely lately. Unemployed at the moment with too much free time on my hands, I'm going through a period of obsessive introspection and combing through my past, and it has alerted me to some alarming things that aren't at all conducive to my current life, community, and ideologies. The pattern of offense I've found most prevalent is in old (5+ years ago) private chats with close friends wherein I make some very bad (not just distasteful, but genuinely un-funny) jokes about real life people based on stereotypes. These include offenses to groups I am part of (women, mental illness), as well as many more I am not part of (POC, different cultures). I think my friends at the time knew the context, knew me, and therefore knew it wasn't malicious in intent and that I was just being an immature idiot. Overall I came off as very judgmental (while at the same time expressing support for progressive policies that promote equality and empathy). Honestly thinking back to my state-of-mind at the moment and where I was and what I was doing, I think I was just trying to be edgy. Why god, why.

This might be more of an anxiety/OCD issue (for which I am in and out of therapy, planning to go back soon), but I am really struggling to reconcile my personal policy of always trying to move forward and be a better person, better feminist, better ally, while being confronted with the great failings of past-me and resulting feelings of shame, remorse, and guilt. Because I usually work in social justice for non-profits, I feel like a hypocrite, an imposter, in-genuine. I want to disappear and hide when I think ""what if friends, colleagues, comrades knew...""

Has anyone else struggled with these feelings?

146,How important do you believe “Big Data” was in the radicalization of anti-feminist sentiment? (And others),"I’ve been thinking on this one since the Channel 4 reports on Cambridge Analytica began rolling out.  If you haven’t seen them thus far, they are pretty essential to understanding the scope of what’s happened.  I would start [here](https://youtu.be/mpbeOCKZFfQ) to get directly to how this affects us, but I’ll give a brief layperson’s summary below (might not be perfectly detailed or accurate, but I myself am a layman in this context):

Per Channel 4’s investigation, Cambridge Analytica, a corporate data analytics and communications company, collected data from Facebook on over 50 million people, ranging from political views and activity, personality traits, demographics data, and possibly even psychological indicators.  (Zuckerberg and Facebook’s influence isn’t known, but it’s assumed that the data was given willingly.)

From there, Cambridge Analytica paired with several other organizations and actors in order to engage in psychographics, or what could best be described as psy-ops, using the American election as an example:

-	Steve Bannon, owner of Brietbart and former board member of Cambridge Analytica (left to join the Trump campaign), who used Brietbart to create and disseminate data-driven fake news for the purpose of stoking and aggravating fears of right-leaning voters
-	Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, at this point regarded as part of Russia’s disinformation arm, to release slow leaks targeted at aggravating similar right-wing sentiments and undermining the credibility of Trump’s opposition
-	Facebook, using hyper-targeted advertisements and ‘suggested’ stories to create an individualized, fabricated, often fake news feed driven by data collected from Facebook
-	Russian troll farms, which received the same Facebook analytics data Cambridge Analytica received, to disseminate fake news and disinformation, derail discussion, and act as bad-faith agitators on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit

Per campaign finance sunshine laws, we know that the Trump campaign, as well as the Mercer family and other billionaire donors, paid Cambridge Analytica tens of millions of dollars through Trump’s campaign and through Super PACs.  We also know Trump (&amp; team) and the Mercers have met directly; Trump and Cambridge Analytica have met directly; the Mercers and Cambridge Analytica have spoken directly; and both the Trump campaign and the Mercers have reached out to Assange to amplify WiliLeaks’ message.  We do not know how much, if any, Putin and other Russian oligarchs have paid to Cambridge Analytica (they are not affected by campaign finance laws as the American donors are).

We also know Cambridge Analytica played a similar role, likely with many of the same actors, in the #Brexit campaign.  Alexander Nix, head of Cambridge Analytica, has boasted about engaging in over 200 such campaigns worldwide.

Okay, with all that in mind, my questions:

**How significant do you feel “Big Data” (hyper-targeted disinformation, fake news, psy-ops campaigns, Astroturfing) is in aggravating and radicalizing anti-feminist sentiments, either as a campaign goal or a corollary to other campaign goals?**  Do you believe antipathy towards feminism has been drummed up or even fabricated in some cases to act as a convenient wedge issue, and to drive interest and voter engagement up on the other side?  Do you believe these sentiments would have fostered organically at the rate they have, or even at all, if not for the presence of bad actors and disinformation acting with coordination on a multinational scale?

**How does this affect the culpability of anti-feminists who have been engaged in this manner?**  There is a saying that “if you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product.”  In this case, how culpable is the “product” for their engagement as a response to this campaign?  Yes, much of what happened was Cambridge Analytica (and related actors) playing on existing fears and biases, and propaganda is nothing new as a concept, but it was also done this time in such an intrusive way as to literally reshape each targeted person’s reality to fit their agenda.  In a very real way, the media we consume shapes our reality, and the media these people consumed—the targeted “news” stories pushed to them, the hyper-targeted advertisements and ‘suggested’ filters, the hijacking of groups and astroturfing within their social networks—turned their reality into a fundamentally different one at all levels.  Obviously, culpability for one’s own actions falls to them, but at what point does the blame for the belief which informs that action fall to the bad-faith actors who have constructed a false social reality around these “products”?

**What do we do about it?** Feminism is in at least some part about messaging and outreach, as dedicated feminists alone cannot achieve all their goals in a timely fashion: there needs to be some coalition-building and broader community engagement to achieve many broader goals.  Some people may need to be dragged kicking and screaming into the achievement of these goals, but that’s the case for all progressive movements.  But if there are potentially tens of millions of people whose worldviews are being shaped by propaganda personalized to exploit *their* weaknesses—if their perceptions are being carefully constructed around them by bad faith actors—if their *realities* are different from ours as a result—how reachable are these people, really?  And if these methods are successful and pervasive enough to force people to the margins on a large enough scale to drive policy and turn elections, what can we do about it?  What *should* be done about it?",AskFeminists,1521588178,rewardadrawer,26,11,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/85xg9l/how_important_do_you_believe_big_data_was_in_the/,2018-03-20

156,Masculinity and Diet,"In 2012, a feminist sociologist wrote an [article](http://www.thefeministwire.com/2012/04/man-v-food-representations-of-meat-and-masculinity/) discussing the link between eating meat and ""hegemonic masculinity"", more commonly called toxic masculinity today.

She expresses disgust at men eating meat, saying that they are in the stone age:

&gt; This scene is obviously a reference to a more primitive masculinity: one in which man was more like an animal, perhaps when man still hunted his food rather than bought it in clean packages obscuring the animal origins. I find this display, and others like it, which finds pleasure and enjoyment in primitive masculinity, rather disturbing. In my view, such primitive performances of masculinity are a throwback that erases feminist work. Perhaps some men might find the Stone Age more ideal, and act on it

Recently, this same author published [another article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07409710.2017.1420355?needAccess=true&amp;journalCode=gfof20) claiming that *veganism* promotes white masculinity.

edit: here is a link to an earlier draft of the article, I apologize that the link I provided only showed the abstract:
https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/bitstream/handle/1840.16/10723/etd.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y

She writes:

&gt; Despite veg* men engaging in “feminized” eating practices, they feel able to subvert 
challenges to a strict gender binary by using masculine ways of explaining their dietary 
decisions to eschew meat and animal products. 
They are able to maintain control of the situation by positioning their choice as one driven by rational conclusions and scientific research.  Masculinizing a feminine practice rather than accepting a feminized identity is a way for these men to subvert challenges to the gender binary and perform a slightly less conventional masculine practice rather than undo it.

In other words, meat = masculine, vegan = feminine, and vegan men are so afraid of femininity that they use ""logic"" and ""reason"" to justify their choice of diet.

What are your opinions on this? It seems like whatever men do, it's wrong.

164,How do you know that your political beliefs are the right ones?,"This is not strictly feminist question, but this is the only political forum that I visit, so I had no idea where to put it. If it violates the rules feel free to remove.

I had to vote for the first time last election and on the voting ballot there were many different laws that people were asked to vote on. Most of the time it feels like I know my political beliefs, but when it came time to actually vote on them I couldn't really decide. I thought researching the laws would clarify the issue, maybe someone somewhere had the answer to which were the correct ones to vote for and which were not. Instead what I found were a series of pro and opposing arguments. One side had their view, the other had their own view. If one side said raising the minimum wage was going to help the poor, the other just said ti would hurt the poor. They both had (from what I could tell) good arguments to agree with. Well if I couldn't find answers there than maybe economists know the answer. After doing even more research I found economists themselves were split about whether this law would be a good one for the poor or a bad one.

What makes it worse was that these laws directly change people's lives and my vote could damage people, so I wasn't eager to just vote blindly. It became rather clear that those arguing for the law were democrats and those against were republicans. On top that there aren't just two political parties, there are communists, socialists, libertarians, anarchists, capitalists, monarchies, and so on. Trying to make sense of all these different perspective's makes me feel like I'm playing with sticky dough.

I mean before I had to vote it was obvious being a democrat was the right way, but then seeing everyone had their own arguments (good ones at that), made me less certain. I my self am a child of social programs, so I've been biased towards liberalism ever since. But some other people say the state is bad and laws should be dismantled.

So anyway if this question doesn't belong here, no hard feelings if it's deleted. I just thought people who are certain in their political beliefs could give some advice on how to decide what political views are more valid.",AskFeminists,1521762620,lordwhatshisface,17,5,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/86gb0f/how_do_you_know_that_your_political_beliefs_are/,2018-03-22
165,What does sexual objectification mean?,"Modern feminism often discusses the idea of objectification as it relates to heterosexual males. My question is what exactly objectification means. It has been shown that over 95% of males past puberty have either watched or been tempted to watch pornography. Pornography is almost entirely visual in nature and most men subconsciously find that they are largely aroused by visual things. This happens near puberty and is almost entirely subconscious. This question is not a moral one, as in I do not condone what someone does with their arousal (I'm not condoning harassment) but it seems as though some feminists deny the fundamental fact that nearly all heterosexual males, occasionally, get aroused visually by the way a woman *looks* and this is entirely natural. I would like to have a discussion on what feminists believe about objectification.",AskFeminists,1521774216,Throwaway444765,35,6,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/86hjjz/what_does_sexual_objectification_mean/,2018-03-22
166,What do you think about dating preferences that exclude Asian men?,"I am a Canadian born mixed man. I proudly claim both Slavic and Asian heritage. Through out my life I tried to figure out where I stood. What was my identity? What effect did my mixed heritage have on that identity?

Mostly, I've identified with the Chinese side of myself, and that is because it is the part of me that always brought out the most dramatic response from people. I've been called a ""ch*nk"" more times than I can count. Had tons of Chinese dick jokes tossed my way, and ""woking"" the dog jokes, and ""me Chinese me no dumb..."" jokes, and... well, you understand. 

I've also been turned down a lot by women because of that side of my heritage, but still to this day I have yet to have a woman turn me down because I am part Slav. 

Personally, I give people the benefit of the doubt with their preferences. I am not in your head, I don't know you or where you have come from. So, in the past when I've been told, ""Sorry, I don't date Asian men"", I just shrug it off and move on. I don't assume that the other person is racist. Even with online dating statistics that suggest Asian men are considered bottom of the barrel (straight or gay), I still give people the benefit of the doubt.

However, I do believe the origins of the preference are racist. I don't believe that these preferences arise from nothing. I believe that these preferences are tied to a history of abuse against Asian cultures, and a crappy, still very predominant love of Orientalism in the West. 

However, I want to know what women (or at least the women on this sub Reddit) have to say about this. After all, you all are the ones who decide who to date and who not to date. As individuals, I mean, and not one large monolithic entity.

171,"Should we forgive/rehabilitate men who try to change, and if so how do we do it?","Hey everyone, so this is something that's been sitting on my mind lately. I'm a progressive and always been very liberal. I was always one to criticize the way our justice system is punitive and always one for restorative justice, and I'm wondering how does that work in the context of the #metoo movement? 

It's something I'm trying hard to reconcile with myself. Earlier this year, there was a story of Michelle Jones: 
http://time.com/4941576/harvard-nyu-michelle-jones/

Someone who went through some really messed up things, reacted in a violent matter and murdered her own child. She went to prison, but then tried to change as a person and actively worked on trying to give back. After 20 years in prison she is now a PhD student at NYU and is doing a lot of good things now.

I found her story beautiful and I found her ability to rehabilitate and become a good person a great story. 

So I'm wondering if that can be done in the same for men who hurt people and how do we as a society move with this? Can these men truly change if given a second chance and how do we decide to give one? If we don't give one does that go against progressive values and restorative justice?

172,Hypothetical Question About False Rape/Harassment Accusations,"To preface, I am not actively worried about ever facing any kind of false accusations of sexual misconduct because I’m well aware that it’s just not that statistically significant of a problem. It happens and it’s awful but actual sexual assault is a far more prevalent of an issue. Unsurprisingly, I’ve never met anyone personally who has been accused of this. But, despite the statistics, this seems to be a common fear among men (and I know it’s largely ire rational) that I find interesting from a psychological perspective. But it did get me thinking though: what SHOULD a person do if they find themselves accused of sexual misconduct?

I don’t mean legally speaking because that has an obvious answer: lawyer up. But I don’t want to focus so much on that mainly because I don’t actually think that that most men are even afraid of going to jail for being falsely accused (and statistically the falsely accused rarely do as those kinds of accusers to tend to either follow certain patterns that professionals easily spot or crack under pressure fairly easily). Rather, I think most are scared of the social consequences (losing friends, family, their jobs, or being publicly branded as a monster). So from that perspective, what can the falsely accused do to prove to others that they’re not unsafe to be around? How can they maintain or repair relationships that are damaged by such accusations? How can they send a believable and genuine message of their innocence? How can these statistical outliers keep their lives from falling apart?

And I want to stress that I know that the issue false accusations is barely even an issue at all when compared to the issue of sexual violence and misconduct in society. This is purely a hypothetical question that I was hoping to have answered from a feminist answer purely out of curiosity. Google wasn’t much help as it lead me to strictly legal advice (which I wasn’t interested in) and the statistics of false accusations (which I was already familiar with). And it’s not like a could go to the MRA’s who treat this like a world-endingly massive issue and hope for a decent answer for obvious reasons. “Something something witch hunt. Something something 50% of rape claims are false. Something something feminazis. Something something misandry.” Definitely didn’t want to deal with that shit hence the reason I came here.

EDIT: Forgot about the rule regarding top-level comments! My bad. But yeah another reason I asked is because sometimes, I don’t think putting a fear in rational perspective is always enough to dispel it. I deal with pretty strong anxiety, right? So using myself as an example, there are tons of things that I actively fear and constantly worry about that I KNOW are irrational but they still keep me up at night because anxiety. I think something similar is going on with a little of men. I can throw statistics at them all I want to get them to realize how unfounded their fears are but more often than not, it affects little change. But with these answers (which have been good so far! Thanks to all who have and will give their honest thoughts), I’ll be be able to say “Here’s what you can do if that happens” which I think will make it easier to follow up by saying “Here’s why you really don’t need to worry about it happening.” At least, that’s my theory.

I like to think that I'm on board with the movement, and I believe in equality for everyone, and clearly the need to highlight what has been happening to women all these years is a step in the right direction, (the next would be some more legislation to protect women, and trans etc.).

Now where I find some complication, is from gender roles. When I was in High School, of course we all want equality and pleasantries (for the most part); but when it came to getting a girl (not all girls) it was about who was more of a man. Not in a literal sense of ""dude i'm so more manly"". It was about who could be smoother, who looked better, etc. That to me is an underlying issue in this whole process, but what obviously doesn't help is that girls who have grown up in this environment unknowingly reinforce these values.

As a girl in High School (again, not all girls) who are they going to want to date? The QB of the football team, or a nerd. (A thousand cartoons will show us the nerd gets the girl, he doesn't.) This is an unfortunate trend that I saw throughout College. Very similar, girls seem a lot more interested in a more assertive, confident male, and masculine male. Some of that is Biology, some of that is what we've been fed through media, etc.

I agree that a lot of this is how males are raised to think, but part of that problem has now caused it to be an expectation, not just to us, but to females. And of course Women deal with this issue as well (e.g friends in high school calling each other fat), that's common place in so many conversations in my experience in High school, and that is so detrimental to how Girls in HS view themselves.

How does a male call himself feminine without emptying the room of the girls he wants to attract? I really want to hear from females on this topic and how they feel?

How do we re-evaluate gender roles so that everyone feels they have a place and purpose? And how can we teach boys AND girls what it means to be boys AND girls in the age we live in?",AskFeminists,1519293894,Ulky2,8,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7zdutm/trying_to_find_a_balance/,2018-02-22

4,"I think we've ""progressed"" in the wrong direction. Do you agree?","I used to consider myself a feminist back when I considered it the idea of raising women up to parity with men, but then I realized men have it pretty shitty in different ways.  For instance, [only men are required by US law to register for military conscription](https://www.sss.gov/Home/Men-26-and-OLDER).  What is that if not blatant sexism against men?

I got to thinking; we have feminism as the idea of raising women up to parity with men, but where's an equivalent idea for raising men up to parity with women?  I want *both* sexes equal under the law, I'll even go so far as to say I think we should legislate according to [John Rawl's Original Position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position), that is we should prescribe policies only under the assumption that we could hypothetically occupy any social status that might be maligned by such a policy, and that we should adjust our prescriptions accordingly.

If I wouldn't want to be treated that way, I shouldn't advocate treating others that way.  The Silver Rule.

And it seems others agree with me, [it looks like Iceland is finally pushing to make circumcision (male genital mutilation) illegal just like female genital mutilation](https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2018/02/21/icelandic_doctors_support_ban_on_circumcision_for_b/).  It's nice to see some progress on this front, but I don't hear many ""progressives"" talk about it, and even perusing through threads on this very subreddit it seems apparent that a genuine consideration for ""equality"" is maligned in favor of scoring victim points, over which form of mutilation is worse.

THEY'RE BOTH BAD.  Can we not agree on that?  Condemning the mutilation of children's genitals universally takes nothing away from the plight of women in particular, they're included in the grievance.  It would seem to me that as much as feminism stands for equality (as it was originally sold to me), it seems fundamentally one-sided in the issues it concerns itself with, and the people who genuinely appear to care enough to ensure that neither side gets a raw deal by and large have distanced themselves from feminism, for the very public way it appears to have disconnected itself from the ideals it was founded on.

If feminists genuinely stood for equality between the sexes, I would still consider myself one.  But instead I see a competition; for who has the advantage, for how long they've had it, and how long the other side is collectively owed for the sins of past generations.  Why shouldn't I just be egalitarian?  Seems that way I can care about people indiscriminately.

The influence of feminism is pervasive in Western society and thankfully growing (the women's march, representation in media, and the #metoo movement are just three examples). We're making great strides for equality and are less afraid to speak up against those in power who oppress others.

It seems, however, that we do not take such strides with minority cultures living in Western culture. When I was in school, my class visited a Mosque and remember the Imam stating that in Islam, ""men must be the breadwinner"" and ""women look after the children"". No one in the room said anything, demonstrating culturally sensitivity. This seems to be the case elsewhere, with us not confronting sexist beliefs of a minority group.

What if white men said that ""women look after the children""? Imagine hearing of a white priest saying this? We would justifiably confront this and point to men, white men, or the church specifically as the offensive group.

24,Do you acknowledge the privilege women have when it comes to the romantic aspect in life?,"Hi, just want to say I agree with the issues being discussed here 90% of the time and this sub has definitely changed my world view for the better. 


However, I still have some ""shadows"" from the days were I fall for the TRP crap. One of those aspects I can't seem to disagree, is that women have advantages when it comes to dating, relationships, and sex. Now it's easy to dismiss this as ""some losers trying to get their dick wet"" and move on, but the truth is that it's a huge aspect of life that deals with romance, happiness, family, support, marriage, kids, you name it. 


As an example, take a man and a woman alone who desire to be with somebody. Can we agree that the woman will be have more options because men will often pursue first, make the first move, etc.

I also understand the disadvantages that come with this. Like sexual harassment, getting catcalled, etc. But it seems like a step above the disadvantages men have: being alone if they don't have the courage to make the first move, or any similar situation. In my perspective, this is like being rich and not being rich, but one of the disadvantages of being rich is that you need to be careful with your money. 

I also understand that white women are a step above when it comes to privilege as opposed to minority women, in this area.

This happened especially in romantic relationships but not exclusive (know of quite a few grudges at work between women colleagues). I honestly know of just one guy who gets angry more often than his woman SO and men I know generally avoid conflict or recover a lot faster from the feeling of anger. 

Now my questions is if you noticed the same thing and if so, do you believe this is due to patriarchy?  

In my case I just have an outburst of anger where I scream or whatever (non-physical) and in 5 minutes I'm good so I don't see how this would have something to do with patriarchy (but I could be missing something).

38,Implicit sexism and the benefits of diversity - a feminist perspective," [This](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2c44/14cde6b6a011e9f4910e6389d658278e3a7a.pdf) paper finds rather interestingly that women are more likely to demonstrate ""automatic in group bias"" - implicit sexism. This trend is seemingly not found in men. 

It would appear from this data that the 'Old Boys Club' effect takes a back seat to 'Sorority Sisters' so to speak. 

The paper suggests the following causes:

1. Women have higher self-esteem and positively associate with their gender identity more (circular reasoning to a degree)
2. The ""women are wonderful effect"". Although this does not explain why men don't prefer women at all. Men seem more neutral. 
3. ""Developmental effects"" - women are raised by women and thus identify strongly with them (somewhat related to point 1). Men are not matched-pairs with their mother (by gender) and thus don't develop a female preference. 
4. ""Implicit bias"" - by viewing all men as threats, women are more likely to prefer other women. Men feel less threatened across the board and thus don't demonstrate favouritism. 
5. Sexual attitudes - men might favour women sexually and this balances their own ingroup bias making them appear neutral. 

What are your attitudes towards this? 

This 'might' be a feminist issue as feminism is pushing for more women in more roles. Suppose this data is true, we *might* predict more sexism as more women enter the work force. I can say from an anecdotal point of view that women are much more discriminatory in letting men in womens' spaces rather than the inverse. As noted above there might be valid reasons, but it certainly seems more common.

For instance, there are plenty of explicitly women's only salons where I live. Not only are female's the only customers, but men are not even allowed in the premises. These shops have all been around for 30 years. 

[A male barber who did the same](http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/close-shave-with-human-rights-commission-for-menonly-barber-store/news-story/96b3dfab677fee8c5c4a3bbca4eebabb) was reported to the Human Rights Commission for sex-discrimination for **doing what female salons had done for 30-40 years**. 

While I understand that there might be reasons to explain the bias, most seem either incorrect or merely play into the notion that women are simply more discriminatory. The most reasonable explanation is the ""implicit bias"" that men are threatening. But from what I've seen, feminism is more likely to increase this view of men as threatening (not reduce it).

40,Is being a homemaker a legitimate choice?,"I'm a 38 year old man working in STEM.  I live a rather traditional lifestyle, which wasn't my choice.  My wife struggled with work due to anxiety when she was young and so I've supported her financially for the last 16 years after she quit her job.  In recent years she's become interested in feminism.  I began to become interested myself, but my reaction was quite different to hers.  The more I read about feminism the more hostile I became to it and we've had a few arguments about it, although lately we've been able to discuss it in a much more gentle way.  I've been wondering why I'm so hostile for a long time now and today I think perhaps I've realised why.  

I'm about to leave my job (to go elsewhere) and a collegue of mine has become extremely worried about it.  He's a man in his mid 50s and he's told me that he feels completely burned out in his job.  He feels that he can no longer keep up with the challenges of continually learning new technology and he feels that my leaving will expose the fact that he lacks the compentency to be the only software developer on our team looking after our product.  He also lives a traditional lifestyle and also looks after a wife who doesn't work.  He feels crushing pressure to support his wife and family in an environment that he no longer feels competent in and the stress is getting to him badly.  He's spent the morning telling me about his heart condition.

It's occured to me that what he feels, and the situation he's in is also a fear of mine.  Ever since I accidentally got myself into the situation of sole breadwinner I've been worried about what would happen if anything ever happened to my health, or my ability to do my job.  The thought of my wife and children having nowhere to live is always in my mind and the pressure is unpleasant.   In truth, true feminism would be a relief.  I'd like to have a wife that had equal responsibility for this stuff.  I'd like to feel that I could fail at this if I had to and could try something new if that day comes.  But I can't.

So here's the thing, I'm hostile to feminism, principally because it calls into question my own relationship and the person who I really love.  I was raised with Christian, patriarchal values, to believe that it's a man's job to be dutiful no matter what, and to love and care for his wife while allowing her to concentrate on the maternal role.  If that is no longer true, then what does that mean for me?  In many ways feminism has happened too late for me.  I must deal with the downsides of traditional roles while also dealing with the downsides of feminism because I won't contemplate leaving my wife and it's rather too late for her to share the burden of breadwinning in a meaningful way.  Her feminism seems like hypocracy in my ears, even though I love her very much, and so I cling to my old paternalistic beliefs since they make me feel ok about the burdens I have to shoulder.

So how should men like me think about feminism?  And is being a homemaker even a legimate choice now?  It seems like even under feminism, it wouldn't be a legitimate choice for me to make.",AskFeminists,1519740016,SexWomble,45,11,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/80mm8a/is_being_a_homemaker_a_legitimate_choice/,2018-02-27

We kind of encountered each other on a post on imgur that has been deleted. I cant remember what the original post was about but my reply was something along the lines of me saying that just because a female or a woman does something silly doesn't mean that i equals feminism and that the original poster was over reacting.

This person then started saying that that isn't what they see and so on and that feminism at its root was anti-male.

I was saying that feminism stands for equality for all genders, and so on and so forth.

They have been countering by quoting Dworkin, Ti-Grace Atkinson and Catharine MacKinnon.

From what I can see they all seem to be radical feminists of the 2nd wave. I think its a little weird that in order to dismiss feminism they have been quoting radical feminists of the last wave of feminism.

49,What do you think of toxic masculinity being reinforced by some feminists regarding a mans height,"Let me start by saying I’m not trying to imply that women are just as superficial as men or that men have it so hard. Obviously though there are societal expectations on body issues that effect us all. So I follow a few feminist run pages on instagram about online dating and they typically just call out gross and immature behavior from men. I see sometimes that they will take the mans height into account in the comments, for example if the guy acted immature over a rejection someone would comment “what a child” and another woman might say “he’s the size of one too”. I know that the guys were being inappropriate but I still feel that to bring up how mans height and how him being on the shorter side makes him less of a man just reinforces toxic masculinity big time. Everyone is attracted to what they are attracted to and short guys can have a hang up about it. So I’m curious do you, feminists of reddit, think it’s appropriate to make statements like that on a platform like the one I mentioned or do you think it contributes to toxic masculinity as a whole?",AskFeminists,1519787173,Username17og,5,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/80sq07/what_do_you_think_of_toxic_masculinity_being/,2018-02-27
50,Language and Feminism,"Hello, this post is strictly for me to understand the feminist point of view on one of the issues I have been seeing more of recently. I consider myself a feminist (I am a male), but one thing I have been unable to wrap my head around is why I have been seeing a lot of people talking about words like ""wo-MAN"", ""fe-MALE"" etc. I understand when people have an issue with ""man"" being used to describe humanity or ""guys"" being used to describe a group of people no matter if it consists of men, women, or both. The part I am confused about is why there is noise around words that have been derived from their masculine counterparts. Obviously, I have researched them and have learned that in the era they were coined, the words did not have the best of connotations and were pretty derogatory. However, I feel in our society now, rarely is the word ""woman"" perceived to demean women. Until recently (when I brought this up to some of my female feminist friends), no female in my life had ever taken issue with these words. I'm not saying it isn't a valid point to be making, since the history behind these words is unacceptable, but I am more concerned with people putting time and energy behind it. Here are the reasons why:

1. I have not yet seen a proposed solution. If there were something we could start using instead of ""woman"" or ""female"" I would gladly hop on board and do my best to use the new words. I feel like the efforts being made right now bear no fruit since there is no potential solution.

2. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that time and energy to more pressing issues like unequal pay, sexual harassment/assault, breaking stereotypes etc. Countless people have proposed ways we can make amends regarding those problems. If we worked towards that instead of language, wouldn't there be real results.

3. I feel language is so deeply rooted in our culture/society that changing that is nearly impossible without first fixing the other problems. I think once women are truly equal, language would naturally change to reflect the new culture. I guess people could say that it's the other way around, but weren't the words initially created in a patriarchal society, therefore influencing language into created terms that were derogatory to womankind?

Well, those are just my thought, please respond because I really want to be able to understand the other side of this. Right now I feel like I am passing judgement without understanding the other side and that makes me feel pretty uncomfortable. Anything to enlighten me would be greatly appreciated!

59,I’m a feminist in love with an MRA.,"Well. The title says it all. 
I dated him for 2 years but I had to break up with him. I love him so much but I realized that because I am a woman he will never love me... And that it was dangerous to be around him. I broke up with him 3 years ago but I still think about him and miss him every. Single. Day. 
He always respected consent (unlike a centrist I dated, interestingly), thank God, and even came to help me after I had been raped by said centrist. He literally carried me to his house and just held me. In that moment I thought he loved me... But he was extremely verbally violent and misogynistic, and I slowly realized that he only saw me the way MRAs see women, with a few moments of love in between. 
I remember planning to give him my virginity but was scared that, because of his views, he would hurt me somehow during or after. 
I see a lot of MRA’s talking about how they believe what they believe because they think they can’t get women, can’t get laid or a girlfriend or whatever. He thinks that too because everyone that’s dated him has broken up with him. 
It’s interesting... If he didn’t have his violent beliefs I would never have left him. I still defend and love him to this day. I only left because I was in danger (I can go into more detail if asked, but I’ll leave it at that for now). 
He knows he has a mental illness that makes him prone to violence, and has admitted to me that he does think that it contributes to his beliefs, as well as the fact that he has a horrible relationship with his mom. 
God I would give my life to help you. 

MRA’s think girls don’t love them. But I think that it’s really that they don’t love us. 

The questions I want to ask are: 
1- Has any other feminist here dated an MRA?

2- What’s your two cents on this situation?

I suspect it's because of the subject matter but I normally don't buy things with such a low review. It's called ""How to Destroy A Man Now (DAMN): A Handbook"" by Angela Confidential Psy.D. Here's the description for those that don't want to click the amazon link 

&gt;A wave of sexual misconduct allegations about powerful men have exploded recently in the media (e.g., the news, Twitter #MeToo, etc.). A bold social movement has begun with brave women coming forward and being applauded for speaking out and sharing their stories of abuse, discrimination, and harassment. As a result, accused men like Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, and dozens more have been removed from power and are suffering the consequences.

&gt;In How to Destroy A Man Now (DAMN), Dr. Angela Confidential (a business psychologist, consultant, and human resource professional) empowers women with a step-by-step guide for destroying a man’s reputation and removing him from power.

&gt;In easy to understand terms, the handbook reveals and explains the fundamental dynamics between allegations, the media, and authority as they relate to male misconduct in today’s society. It also unveils and details practical real-world methods for leveraging allegations, media, and authorities to dethrone a man from power.

I want a more objective opinion or a tl;dr before I decide to read it myself. I should make it clear how antagonist the review section is, there are a lot of angry people rating this book, and it's existence could uphold anti-feminist ideas, like uninformed opinions on the SCUM Manifesto.

edit: I haven't bought the book, I wanted opinions other than the amazon rating section because it's toxic.

But I am often disappointed by how limiting it is for woman here. I don’t know if they are used to it and accept it or not. I can’t possibly speak up about this issue for obvious reasons and the only woman who I have talked with in person for a long period of time all my life has been my mother and I feel extremely helpless.
I am also disappointed with most of my friends who keep saying awful things to women because of a few bad experiences and was let down when I asked them about how they felt about the woman in this country and they responded by saying life for woman is easy here and all they did was ‘make babies, have food and gossip.’ This was quite surprising, since they seemed rather progressive and I share my opinions with them for almost every other matter.

77,"Lots of restaurants and bars and pubs and clubs have taken to creating code words, and encouraging women 2 use them if they want to discreetly ask for help if they feel unsafe around their date. Are those code words really effective?","Lots of restaurants and bars and pubs and clubs have taken to creating code words, and encouraging women 2 use them if they want to discreetly ask for help if they feel unsafe around their date. Are those code words really effective?

This trend appears to have started within the last few years. In the town of Lincolnshire in UK a pub has a sign put up in the women's restrooms where women are encouraged to ask for Angela. This is specifically targeted to women who are meeting up in real life with somebody they met on and online dating platform such as POF or Tinder. The sign stated that if one feels unsafe around their date, or if they feel like something's wrong instinctively, or if their date isn't who they said they are, then they should simply ask one of the staff members for Angela, and the staff members will discreetly arrange for a taxi to take them home.

In early 2017, social media and the news media discussed a similar measure that was found in the women's restroom of a Hooters restaurant in South Africa. The posters had similar wording, and that they were targeted towards women who feel unsafe on their dates for a variety of reasons such as their date, whom they met online, isn't who they said they are, for they feel unsafe, for they feel like something's wrong even though there's no outward signs. There were three different tiers of the Angel shot, shut depending on which one you asked for, a staff member we're either escort you to your vehicle, or call an Uber or Lyft for you, or would call the police. A bar in Florida also chose to use the angel shot for women who wanted discreetly ask for help without alarming their dates.

Of course, there's lots of reasons 4 having things like this. The pub in Lincolnshire stated that their reasoning was that ever since online dating became more popular, rates of sexual violence increased dramatically. It seems as though online dating makes it easier for people to harm others.

And of course, the reason why somebody would want a reason to discreetly ask for help in a public establishment is because lots of women are scared to reject their dates out of fear that their dates naked violent. I recall hearing news stories about men murdered women in public places after being rejected. And some women they fear that they would get hurt if their dates found out that they were trying to leave.

However, lots of people have lots of skepticism about whether or not these measures would be effective or not. A possible concern is that due to the media coverage of these code words, it could render them useless because then people will not be able to secretly ask for help anymore. Though of course, a potential solution to that issue is for each establishment to create their own unique secret code words. Another issue is that's none of these establishments have explained exactly how they will distract the people that the women wants to discreetly get away from. A concern that I have is that if the establishments are not careful, and they accidentally expose the fact that the women wants to leave their date early, and their dates gets violent, not only will this be bad because of women ended up getting hurt, but this may make women not want to ask for help at all because even though things have recently started to get better, women who are being abused or threatened or still having trouble getting people to help them, and so they don't ask for help because they don't feel safe, and if a woman asks for help, and she still ends up getting harmed, this may make women not want to asked for help in the first place if they fear that the people who are willing to help them are too incompetent to actually help them.

This seems like a good idea, but it's not enough for it to be a good idea. It has to lead to good outcomes, and it has to be implemented in a good way.

83,"If gender roles were finally abolished, would it affect the left and right of politics?","One theory about the left and right in politics is that the two poles exist because people project out the maternal and paternal gender roles onto society.  Essentially modelling society based on their more intimate model of the family.

The left is maternal, she wants to make sure all of her people have enough, she wants to nurture those who are being left behind, she is cooperative and wants to be inclusive of those who are different or strangers.

The right is paternal, he wants to make sure his people are strong and self reliant believing in tough love, he wants his family to be successful and competitive, he cares about the defense of his family, he is suspicious of strangers.

This way of thinking about the world goes back a long way, it's paralleled in the old polythiestic religions in figures like Mars and Venus, Frejya and Thor.  Toaism represents it in the form of Yin and Yang and thinks that the two seemingly opposing forces must be in balance.

The twin tyrannies of Nazism and Communism during the 20th century can in a way be thought of as an unbalancing.  The first, like an over-domineering violent father and the second like a tyrannical and over-protective mother.  

For a long time I've found it interesting that men and women today tend to have a slightly different voting bias with regard to left and right.  There are no doubt some practical reasons for this, but I also wonder if it doesn't relate a little to an underlying affinity.

So if gender roles became a thing of history, what would politics look like?  Would the left and right remain?  Or would the idea morph into something else?  What do you think that something else would look like?

84,"[long] Questions and (critical) line of thought regarding non-binary, from an EU citizen, that only has a limited experience with gender-theory.","So first off, I'm from Austria, where this whole thing hasn't taken off yet, so please excuse my ignorance and understand that I'm not trying to offend anyone, I just asked myslef questions last night, followed my train of thought and arrived at a critical standpoint. In the end this message is motivated by curiosity and intent to understand this movement. I'm also writing out my entire thought-process, which might come off as condescending, but I do it, so there is no misunderstanding, since we lead different lives in different places.

So first off since I'm from a german-speaking country, the gender-sex-issue is confusing to me, since in german there's only one word called ""Geschlecht"". Now ""Geschlecht"" is purely biological and since German works differently, if you wanted to express a deviance from ""Geschlecht"" you'd just distinct between ""biologisches Geschlecht"" (=biological sex/gender) and ""gesellschaftliches/soziales Geschlecht"" (=societal/social sex/gender).

Starting my thought-process: we are in the group of human. The group human can be split in a lot of ways, like people that enjoy reading books and people that don't. 

Another way to split 'human' is into male and female. This split makes sense, since the part that defines males and females physically, behaviourally, in thought, action and sexual function (DNA) is very similar, but also produces deviance, that allows prediction of male/female, in 95% of cases in interest based surveys (as an example; source: Jordan Peterson) and deviance that allows prediciton of sex/gender by simply looking at another person (in the majority of cases).

Now you may disagree with the male/female split this way, but I think we have common ground, in that we both understand why this split would come to exist. I think we also both agree that there is this deviance in males and females as it has been proven again and again.

Now there's also the group of intersex people, so people with genetic abnormalities, that make them fundamentally different in all the aspects that define humans (again: appearance, thought, actions, DNA,...). Conditon such as Klinefeltner-syndrome. This affects less than 0.8% of people, but them having an extra group makes sense. I won't mention them again in this message, but for the sake of integrity I wanted to name them, please just add them as an asterisk moving forward.

What I also want to add is that I understand transgender people, since they operate within the undercategories for human I have just laid out. They are just in one undercategory and feel like their behaviour, thought and interest do not match their biological undercategory they were born with.

So to come to actual question: what makes you, as a non-binary person, so different from cis people, that it requires a new category made for you, besides male, female and intersex (as I said transgender people operate within male/female, so while they are an additional specification, they aren't a group of their own). Your behaviour isn't different from cis or transgender people. Your thought isn't different, your biology isn't and your actions aren't (in my very limited experience). 

When I look through this [list](http://genderfluidsupport.tumblr.com/gender) of genders (which I don't know if you support), the difference between a cis-person and a person that identifies as one of these genders, isn't bigger than the differences between cisgender-people. 

So basically, most of the genders listed, might as well be aspects of a personality, i.e. character traits, or ""quirks"". For example: ""Affectugender: a gender that is affected by mood swings"", might as well be described as: ""a male/female, that sometimes feel differently and with their different feelings they change wheter they see themselves as male/female"". 

What I'm trying to say is that this difference alone does not warrant the creation of another group besides male/female/intersex and especially not the legal recognition of such group (in my opinion). So my conclusion is, that non-binary peole aren't ""different-enough"" to get non-binary as an accepted group.

Now I don't care if you say you are non-binary, because it makes you feel more accepted or simply makes you feel better. My problem is that this took the concept of sex=gender (which still exists in a lot of legal documents in the US, as far as I know) and makes one different from the other. 


This has giant legal ramifications, which get further exacerbated by the fact that gender is a spectrum and there is no limit on what a gender is, so defining legal parameters on something that isn't even defined itself is impossible. This could lead to exploitation and should the non-binary definition of gender be leaglly protected (i.e. misgendering becomes a legal act of violence, so battery/assault), then one would have to naviagte the world on egg-shells, since you never know what gender one could have, what even qualifies as a gender and what the attributes of a certain gender are. See: bill C-16 (and compelled speech) in Canada.

*Follow up question and further train of thought, that should be answered after question one and works on the presupposition that you couldn't change my mind regarding question one:*

So since I came to the conclusion that non-binary people aren't different enough to warrant this change, my question is, if you cannot find a compelling reason, that would require the establishing of non-binary, then why are you trying this hard to make it a reality. Why do you get together and insist on pronouns, why do you engage in heated debates, why do you paint a target on yourself? Why say I'm Anxiegender (a gender that is affected by anxiety) and not instead say: I have anxiety and my anxiety has impact on wheter I feel like I'm male/female. 

One version is legally problematic and takes an old working concept, throws it out of the window and stirs controversy, while the other sounds pretty reasonable and shouldn't find much resistance. Why go through all the trouble to find acceptance, when there is already a way to become accepted if you just lay out your character traits differently?

Also there is the issue of practicality: I personally don't understand, how one can live as, for example, Caelgender (a gender which shares qualities with outer space or has the aesthetic of space, stars, nebulas, etc.). I guess they are just into space and spirituality/astronomy(?). I don't understand how this impacts wheter or not you feel like a male/female (and if it doesn't impact this, again, why call it a gender when gender used to be equal to sex, why not just call it something else. This just waters down what gender means, leads to conflict and serves no purpose).

I hope all my points are logical, I didn't offend anyone too much and I didn't make too many mistakes regarding my English. I want to reiterate at this point, that my intentions are not mean-spirited, I just couldn't fall asleep and followed this train of thought, which raised these questions.

88,Can nonbinary people be feminists? How?,"I'm 33 and I've been researching feminism on my own since I was 19. It's been quite the journey, and I will just leave it at that. I have a ton of stuff on my mind, some political and some personal, and basically a lot of anger and I don't know who to talk to about any of this. If anyone can point me to a more appropriate place to ask my questions, please do, because I can't seem to find anything on my own--it seems that most feminist communities are underground and word-of-mouth.

I'm nonbinary and have felt that way since I was 4 without having the words to describe it or even realizing the option was there (i.e. that's the only thing that reminds me it's internal and I'm not making it up). Lately this has been a loaded issue for me, and I will try to keep this brief...  

First, I feel like as a nonbinary person, I can't speak for women, and need to step down and ignore the crap I've dealt with while perceived as one, but if I choose to identify as a woman, I'm enabling transphobia and betraying nonbinary people. How do nonbinary people fit into feminism? It seems to me a lot of cis feminists consider afab nonbinary feminists traitors and amab ones appropriators?

Second, I sometimes fear that I have some internalized misogyny tangled up with my nonbinary identity, so how can I untangle that? I notice other afab nb people say things like, ""I'll accept any pronoun except 'she/her,'"" and ""I'm not JUST a woman,"" and I make a concentrated effort to not suppress anything about myself that may be perceived as feminine or womanly, but allowing myself to slip back into woman-mode makes me anxious and dysphoric and I worry about the source of those feelings. I previously had a man-hating phase (19-ish) and have always held women in high regard, so me having internalized misogyny seems unlikely...I don't know, maybe I'm really just transphobic.

I see other people in my life whom I care about also struggling with self-hatred; how can I help them heal from internalized oppression as well?

I think of myself as a feminist but I'm admittedly rather badly educated in the theory and rhetoric of it. So I feel pretty poorly equipped to deal with my guy friends who have started becoming sexist douchebags. 

One of them (let's call him Jim) read this book a little while ago called ""No More Mr Nice Guy: A Proven Plan for Getting What You Want in Love, Sex, and Life"" and made this his bible. He talks about it nonstop, and it's begun to influence the other friends in the group-- one of whom is a great guy who just gets frustrated with not being noticed by girls/people in general, and the other who just went through a breakup and is looking for comfort. Now Jim says he's taken the overtly-sexist comments made in this book with a grain of salt, but he's totally oblivious to the implicit sexism of seeing the problem with the ""pussification"" of men and seeing women as means to be manipulated rather than ends in themselves. He's also started saying shit at bars like ""man look at those titties, I just want to go up and grab 'em."" I've mentioned all of this to my friends (pretty sure Jim is beyond saving here), but nothing seems to get through because the book has quick answers for their problems and I obviously don't.

102,"Is he sexist, hypothetical","Say you are in public and a large guy walks up and starts hitting on you. You politely say no, but he gets angry. He starts harassing you, he shouts in your face, calls you a slut, and becomes physically agressive. A passerby (who is a male feminist, and much smaller than the harasser) walks up to the harasser and smoothly says ""hey dude, relax."" The passerby wants to deescalate things nonviolently, so he gives the harasser a chance to walk away without losing face. He says ""It's just a girl, who cares, this bitch isnt worth your time"". The harasser calms down and leaves. Would you consider the passerby to be a feminist? Would you expect him to go further in advocating for the woman? Why or why not?

I was just having my coffee and was thinking about a scenario where a man working in a company would refuse to socialize with his women colleagues outside work.

110,How do you deal with Misogyny? Preventative? Reactive measures?,"Well, my question is a little more specific, but I think my title is pretty on topic.

So, recently on Reddit I've come across a group of people? I don't know what to classify them as, or if they're deserving of a classification, regardless, you're probably familiar with them, the ""Incels."" Or rather, Involuntarily Celibate.

It's a group of men who for one reason or another seem to have gone through severe existential crisis, or are overreacting to lesser existentialist or nihilistic based paranoia about their own lives.

""Incels"" or ""Involuntarily Celibate."" They're men who blame outside factors for their lack of success with women romantically or sexually. Among other things. And this boils down to them having no hope for the world, they were born with zero chance of ever reproducing or finding love. Might as well die, etc.

Now, my question really boils down to wanting to help them. Their line of thought is REALLY depressing, and they seem to advocate suicide. But I don't know how you would begin to approach the topic.

They're completely against talking to women, they're violently Misogynistic, so I wold imagine they're not interested in speaking with feminists.

but my question is, how would you begin to try to help these individuals? Do you prevent more people from becoming like them? Is there anything inherently wrong with their beliefs? Other questions like this I think would be fun to answer.

113,"Wage inequality - a case study, and a request for advice","Ok, so disclaimer first, this is an obvious throwaway account, as I'm not interested in having my reddit name becoming public knowledge at work.

Background: I'm the manager of a small specialized group (currently 5 employees) at a medium sized company. Our work is in a applied semi-academic field that is traditionally a bit male dominated. My current employees are all male. I'm looking to fill a job opening, and after the first round of interviews, we have three potential candidates, two men, one woman. All three are roughly equally qualified, all three are of about the same age, and frankly, I'd be happy to work with any of them, they all seem to be great people.

Part of the first round interview is establishing their desired salary andmaking sure that it's within the range the company is willing to pay. They're all within the acceptable range, but the woman is asking on the lower end of that range, whereas the two guys are both asking for something a bit above the middle of the range.

Simply in the interest of heterogeneity within the team, I'm inclined to pick the woman. But what should I do about salary? I see the following choices, each with certain problems:

a) hire her at the salary she's asking for and accept that after that, the lone woman in my team would be earning less than her male colleages?

b) hire her at the salary the guys are asking for. But then, this feels condescending, because she's not asking for my help and also it would be unfair to the existing employees, who got their current salaries by negotiation. Besides, I do have a certain responsibility to handle the companies funds in a responsible manner.

c) tell her that we'd be glad to hire her at that salary, but also mention that she's asking for less than her male competition, and ask if she would like to revise her demands. This also seems a bit condescending, and it's basically the same as option b) with some legalese thrown in.

d) hire one of the guy and avoid the drama. This is obviously the cowards way out, but it's also the scenario that's least likely to blow up in my face.

So? Ideas, input, recommendations, considerations are welcome. I'm asking here, because while I try to be empathic and imagine the situation from all sides, I can't possibly assume that my impression of a feminist point of view is accurate.

I dunno I guess I want to know what you think of a debate when logic breaks down.

122,"I [white dude] was a misogynist and rampant sexist until I later became a feminist. After repenting, am I allowed to wear ""Times Up"" pins et al on my suit? (long post)","This is an honest question and I'm here to learn. I'm 30, born in 87, and cishet white male -- for context. I'm not asking if men can be feminists, but a more specific example. I have not seen something like this in the FAQ.

I grew up with a mother who in hindsight was not very feminist and a father who is very set in his old ways. They divorced when I was young and stopped being parents not long after that. They provided food and shelter but not much else. 

I joined the USMC at 18 and there I learned a lot of very negative viewpoints on women and masculinity that reinforced lessons I was taught by society around me. I did not seek out or understand the many points of consent, feminism, equality, and all of the things I now know of until I left the military and started going to college. From there, it was a 6 year journey of slow change due to reading about feminism, becoming friends with feminists, and eventually getting engaged to one, and now I am in a much better place. I have reached out to women I've dated in the past and have apologized for the things I said, for rules I would try and hold for the relationship, and how much of a general asshole I was. How skewed my worldview was and how while I was not taught any better, it still wasn't an excuse because I could've tried to learn myself instead of just carrying on. 

My main question, if I'm a recovering misogynist, have sought out and apologized for my past behavior, and believe in my heart that I have changed after years of work, am I allowed to partake in the ""Times Up"" movement? Am I allowed to wear the pins?

I ask because I see examples of men in hollywood wearing them and women scoffing that person X is a POS who doesn't deserve to wear them and I don't know what to say. I want to show the world that I've changed and help women and men further the cause of equality but I know I sort of fall into the category of potentially not belonging. I also don't want to assume I'm allowed in because of anything and it's probably not my place to decide if I'm allowed to participate in these movements.

124,Why should anyone - male or female - have their careers damaged by allegations in the absence of any actual findings of guilt?,"The backlash from some quarters against Gary Oldman and Kobe Bryant winning Oscars last night perfectly sums up something which I have always found abhorrent about a specific brand of feminism.

From Forbes:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/03/05/oscars-2018-gary-oldman-kobe-bryant/#9eed63755336

&gt;Oscars 2018: Gary Oldman And Kobe Bryant's Wins Are A Disappointing Step Back

&gt;These gestures made for an inspiring, lightly progressive Oscars ceremony on the surface, one that perhaps hinted at Hollywood’s willingness to tackle its own lack of representation and sexual harassment problem head-on. Which is why its awarding of accused abusers Gary Oldman and Kobe Bryant felt like a disappointing step backward.

&gt;To recap: Oldman won Best Actor for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Twitter users skewered the actor for his victory as reports resurfaced that Oldman’s then-wife, Donya Fiorentino, accused him in court of domestic abuse in 2001. Bryant, meanwhile, won the Best Animated Short Film award for Dear Basketball, despite more than 16,000 people signing a petition for the film to be removed from the ballot due to a sexual assault accusation against the former basketball player dating back to 2003.

First of all, I am entirely aware that not every feminist supports guilt by accusation. I'd go so far as to say that in my experience, it's only a *very* vocal and prominent minority who actually do. But if there are any of those here who feel like responding, how do you justify this sentiment? How do you justify giving me, or you, or indeed anyone else, a mechanism to instantly damage somebody for any reason, without any recourse for that person to defend themselves? The fact that neither Bryant or Oldman have ever been found guilty of the allegations which they faced in the past should be enough to exempt them from this kind of condemnation. 

This is not a gendered issue either, as I see it. I am perfectly aware that I could have easily have destroyed the careers of any of my teachers or college professors, male or female, with a tweet if I'd wanted to, and if I was the type of absolute monster to do something like that. I'm not, and obviously most people are not, but to accept the idea that an allegation should, for instance in this case, disqualify an actor or actress from receiving an award even if they are judged to have been the most deserving nominee in that award category, is to deny the existence of nasty people - or to state that giving them the power to *unconditionally and irrevocably* damage those with whom they have some axe to grind is a worthwhile sacrifice, or even just not a problem at all.

In my country, we are currently dealing publicly with a scandal in which a police whistleblower, somebody who exposed very deep rooted and extensive corruption within our police force, was falsely accused of child molestation by a relative of one of his colleagues against whom he had made complaints of professional misconduct. By the standards of many feminists, that should just be the end of his career - and even though the allegation was never proven and has been suggested as having been deliberately hyped up by the whistleblower's superiors, he should be demoted from his job as a police chief and should never receive another award or promotion. That seems to be the standard by which these things are currently being judged - that even if somebody is never found guilty in court, if they are accused, their career should be over and their life should be ruined as a result, particularly if they are any kind of public figure.

I find it absolutely impossible to get behind this sort of mentality, particularly living in a country in which we are, right now, being told a story of an innocent man fighting against state corruption having his life and family utterly torn apart by a false allegation designed to hurt him.

Does anyone who actually supports the idea that Oldman and Bryant shouldn't have received awards, or that their awards were ""a backwards step"" for the Oscars, have any answer to the points that I've raised? Or are innocent people such as the police whistleblower I've mentioned simply regarded as acceptable collateral damage in the (justified) crusade against sexual assault?

134,"Is 'modern' feminism trying to eliminate the cultural differences associated to male and female, so that the only difference is physical appearance?","- I understand 'traditional' feminism is about equal social rights between men and women (like wage / salary, democratic participation, and general consideration as having the same potential for anything as a male). 

- I think modern feminism claim is slightly more radical, something like: 'men and women should be considered exactly equal on everything'. 

- Heterosexual sexual attraction is based on polar opposites qualities: both cultural and biological characteristics. Physical appearance differences are obvious (not need to mention them); yet cultural differences (like bravery or ability to provide associated to men, amongst many others) seem to be more 'traditional'. Homosexual sexual attraction takes cultural gender-associated characteristics into account as well. In general, these cultural differences are  responsible of comments like: 'He's manly / she's femenine', or 'she behaves like a male / he is effeminate'.

136,When is someone sexist?,"

Something I've seen rub people the wrong way is the generally progressive idea that prejudice+power=sexism (or racism or whatever ism) and not does not just mean a prejudicial belief that something is inherently better than another. So for instance you have women telling men that they cannot be sexist to men even though they are exhibiting obviously negative and prejudicial behavior to them because they don't possess the power or privilege that they (sometimes rightly, sometimes not) perceive a man as having. 

I'm wondering what your thoughts were. At what point will we be able to call women sexist? Are there conditions now where women can be sexist to men if certain intersectionalities are met?  If feminism is about enabling women to have more power, but not necessarily combating prejudices, then by this definition of sexism is the end goal to be sexist?

138,Patriarchy under a Queen?,"Hi, everyone!

I’m posting this on a throwaway because don’t want to make my main account super political.

I’m proud to consider myself a feminist and I recognize that *society* is sexist but I can’t wrap my head around the “patriarchy” claim, especially in the Commonwealth. Elizabeth II has been Queen since 1952. In the United Kingdom, from 1979 to 1990 and 2016 to present, the Prime Minister has been a woman as well. On top of that, currently, the President of the Supreme Court and First Minister of Scotland are also women.

In Canada, Elizabeth II is Queen, there was a woman Prime Minister in 1993, 3 of the last 5 Governors General (since 1995) have been women and, between 2000 and 2017, the Chief Justice was a woman. 

I certainly believe *people* are sexist (and people make up society) but I don’t see this in government.
Considering everything above, how is the Commonwealth a patriarchy? Is it simply *less* patriarchal than other countries like the United States?

139,Do you feel that your personal/professional relationships with women who are not really feminists were negatively affected ?,"Hello,

The question is open to anyone but I believe men will **maybe?** have a more vast experience with this.

In my (European) country you see very few women that are true feminists (or at least the women I interacted with).

In my dating, professional and generally in my personal life (i.e. friends) I mostly find women that are not really pro-equality.

They are mostly pro-favoritism or even anti-feminism/equality because if you discuss a point with them about equality you at some point get to a place where they clearly say ""no...men should be doing that"".

I will give some examples which are not necessarily conversations:

1. We were moving from one part of the office building to another and my female manager asked the 2 guys in the team (10 people in total) to move the roll-boxes from the old location to the new one. Nobody said shit about it (including the us guys because everyone would look at us shocked).

2. If you ask a woman if they are equal to men they will say yes without batting an eye or that we are only different in terms of general physical strength which is great but if you raise a question about should ""women do - insert male gender role -"" they will say that men should be doing that (e.g. pay for the first date)

3. If a woman is verbally abusing (cursing the shit out of) a man and he retaliates in kind he is seen as the aggressor even if he was basically in ""self-defense"". This is because ""you should never threat a lady like that no matter what"".

This is probably due to lack of education/ignorance in terms of equality and I can't even hope to explain to them why it is wrong to think/say/do/not do something that is against equality because I would be seen as not-a-team-player, impolite, not well raised or whatever.

My question is, how the hell do I deal with that? How do you make those relationships work?

While typing this I realized that I'm describing the issues with men almost every feminist woman must be dealing with.

144,Gay male vs gay female sex culture,"Gay men and gay women seem to have very different cultures when it comes to sex.  In gay male culture, sex is incredibly important.  It is well documented how important it is.  But in gay female culture, sex seems to not be very important.  There is something called ""lesbian bed death"".  Also, in the past there was a movement within the lesbian separatist movement where they believed that lesbians didn't need to have sex with each other to be intimate.  They believed that all they had to do was hold hands and kiss each other.

My question is why do you think sex is so much more important to gay male culture?  And does this give good evidence to the differences between men and women when it comes to sexuality?

149,Question about Feminist moderating on Reddit,"I'm new to Reddit, and so far it's not clear how moderation works between conflicting subcultures of feminism, or conflicting activist subcultures generally. 

One example is how Eco-Feminism has an aspect of gender essentialism that is not in sync with the gender constructivism of other subcultures, such as Postmodern Feminism, that criticizes gender essentialism. Another more obvious one is a division between Radfem and Third-Wave, that conflict in ways. 

I'm only here a few days, but it seems that the creators of communities are the ideological leaders and gatekeepers of those communities, which I suppose works for the autonomy of subcultures.

The problem I imagine I'll see, is something like 4 versions of transnational intersectionality, definitions of which are different depending on the feminist subculture, which is to say the moderator led manifestation of that subreddit. 

Transnational Intersectionality is central to my interpretation of political philosophy, which is also connected directly to child development, education, science, social science, cultural psychology, argumentation theory, and a bunch of other specific disciplines, which are key aspects of a cultural psychology and education approach to social justice advocacy. 

in order words, while it is transnational, it's a pretty specific praxis, and doesn't belong in an existing subculture of feminism, to my knowledge at this point. 

Part of being new on Reddit is seeing there are thousands of 'subreddits' that seem underused compared to popular ones. I imagine it's a known issue that 'lowest common denominator' sort of effect pushes innovative approaches to the margins.  

If there is a transnational feminist subreddit that has a focus on child development, moral development (Lawrence Kohlberg), and a strong focus on education in relation to social justice advocacy, that would be the one I fit in. It's essentially Cross-Cultural Psychology meets Feminism.  

From what I understand, if there is not one for that specific niche, I create one after a month, and would become the 'gatekeeper of the ideology', for that community, which seems to me to be the way it works generally on Reddit. 

From what I gather, such a specific niche would probably not be popular or noticed much, but would afford me to control a consistent presentation of the philosophy. 

Let me know if any that is right or wrong, and generally how inclusivity is managed between so many diverse subcultures. ",AskFeminists,1520469410,timmycatchores,15,3,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/82tdwy/question_about_feminist_moderating_on_reddit/,2018-03-07
150,How do I personally deal with these anger issues towards women?,"I'm a 23 year old guy. I've been to therapy for many years and take psyche meds.

Recently I asked out one of my classmates. Well, we first went out to a bar and then things sort of fizzled out. I then asked her out for coffee and she said sure. And then I never heard from her again. I could tell she wasn't interested.

The other day I walked past her and she completely ignored me.

I don't know why, but I have this extreme anger. I feel like I'm going to blow up. I feel like punching her or slapping her. Or spitting on her.

Now, I know all of these things are horrible and I shouldn't do them.

But why do I feel so compelled to do such a thing? Yes, I've been rejected by women countless times. No big deal. But this person just makes me ferouciously angry. I feel so angry at her rejecting me. I know she is entitled to her feelings. I know not everyone is going to like you. But I still can't escape from these feelings of anger.

I stay far away from her. And yet, it just keeps popping back into my head, this anger I have towards her. I feel so furious.

And it's starting to scare me. I'm so scared I might do something. I've been staying away from alcohol. What seems to keep me grounded and sane is marijuana. Everytime I smoke, I realize all my anger is stupid and I should just move on. But when I'm sober, I just feel this massive anger against her.

I feel so ashamed of my thoughts and feelings. I can't believe I feel this way towards a woman. It's so pathetic and shameful. And I think maybe I get off on that shame? I don't know.

I do go to therapy. I do tell my therapist all this, and yet I can't seem to find a solution.

I don't know how to stop feeling so angry and bad all the time. I wish I could just move far far away and forget this person. But I still keep feeling angry that she rejected me so coldy and shittily.

151,Revoking consent during sex,"Hi all,

My girlfriend told me last night that during sex with her ex boyfriend she would tell him to stop and start crying when he didn’t. This happened more than once and she started self-harming as a result. 

She then went on to say it wasn’t really rape because she’d already consented to sex. She also said he was actually a nice guy and “in fairness, we remained friends after breaking up”

This was the first time she’d ever told anyone. I find her take on what happened and his character quite troubling. Can anyone please link me to some resources/articles on this subject so that she can explore what happened without it being only with me, a romantic partner?

I feel this would be healthier than me trying to convince her it isn’t okay, it was rape and that he isn’t a nice guy worthy of friendship. That’s not my place.

154,Should people who disagree with feminism/social justice be deplatformed?,"There appears to be a wide-spread trend to protest against people who disagree with feminism/social justice, labeling them sexist/racist/etc, and doing whatever it takes (legal or illegal) to have them deplatformed. It is common to have speakers at private university events get fire alamrs pulled on them, or even have them beaten up. A few recent examples are youtuber Sargon's event, getting stormed by Antifa, and the TA who got in trouble for showing a Jordan Peterson video in class, for the purpose of having students give couner-arguments.

The reason I often hear for this is the slippery slope argument. That, if they disagree with a feminist proposal, in spite of claiming to be for equal rights, it will lead to them setting the stage for gradually undermining equality.

Here are some examples of anti-feminist positions that are *not* against equal rights, in my opinion:

* opposing free abortions/contraceptives. I fully believe free abortions/contraceptives are a good idea. However, many of these people have this ideology as part of ""all healthcare should be private"", and are all for women having the rights to do with their body as they choose, but they should pay for it themselves, just like all other medical procedures. Yet countering this suggestion by calling them ""sexist"" will not change their mind, and makes their audience wary of feminism. Debating them on free healthcare or showing them how the 2 are not necessarily related would likely be much more effective.

* opposing quotas and forced diversity. As a woman working in a male-dominated field, I also feel that quotas do more harm than good. When I heard a boss of mine say ""we would like to hire more women, it's just that so few of them apply"", it made *me* question if I was there based on merit, or if he just hired me because I was a woman, in spite of knowing I have all the relevant qualifications. What would a stranger think of me, knowing I work for a company that is willing to hire less qualified women for the sake of ""diversity""? To me, it seems like the best way to promote women in these fields and break the stigma is to have the few who get there show that they are great at their job, and not to have a policy in place that adds an extra barrier to their credibility. Yet, saying ""forced diversity is maybe not the best idea"" is enough to get people labeled sexist and even fired (see the Google scandal).

* disagreeing on ""gender pay gap"". With the recent CNN scandal, there are a lot of good points being made on how there is no unwarranted pay gap. Women working there are not ""being paid less for the same work"", and there were several investigations in that company showing that those women were, in fact, doing a completely different job than the news anchors who were paid more. Yet those counter-arguments are also dismissed as sexist.

To achieve the end-goal of equality, which I believe the majority of feminists have, would it not be in everyone's best interest to listen to these counter-arguments, and re-evaluate the proposal? Even if you think that person is as bad as Hitler, would it not be worth it to evaluate his statement and counter his argument, not necessarily to change his mind, but maybe to have an impact on their audience?

This is not the first time something like this has happened. We've been together for almost 4 years now and since the beginning the issue of feminism and male deconstruction has been a part of our life together. As of right now, though, I have reached a turning point and while the article by Shea Emma Fett helped a lot to elucidate our more recent problems, I feel that it is insufficient to explain everything that puts me in the place of agressor. She is a female, talking about her perception of the aggression she received, but to understand what leads me to oppress my wife in ways I don't want to do any more, I feel I need the point of view of a man who has walked the path of deconstruction more profoundly than I have so far. So instead of reading about how to identify the agressor in your partner and how to deal with that, I should be reading about how to identify and deconstruct the agressor in me. Do you know where I can find such material?

158,Can anyone provide an explanation for what seems to be a significant differences behind the concept and impact of white privilege vs. male privilege?,"More specifically, I agree with the idea that being non-white can provide barriers to positions of power through institutional racism, social prejudices, etc (Using the US as an example).  I understand that it doesn't necessary provide a white person specific advantage to a specific position, however, it does provide the benefit of not having to contend with the disadvantages faced by those from non-majority races.  Importantly, there is nothing a white person needs to do in order to benefit from this privilege and there is no institutional, personal, or other downside to being part of the majority.   In general, you face no disadvantage or oppression in your life as a result of being part of the white majority.

However, I often see many feminists extend the idea of unilateral privilege and/or unilateral oppression to gender where the model doesn't seem to work in the same way and there are major difference in the real world outcome.  For example, the idea of ""male privilege"" is fundamentally different in that it comes with a strict set of gender expectations, norms, and roles (many harmful) which society forces upon men, while no similar types of expectations exist with regard to white privilege.  A white individual doesn't need to conform to a strict set of white guidelines that directly impact every aspect of their life to have privilege.  In fact, you don't even have to act ""white"" to enjoy white privilege (for example white rappers like Eminem or white rock bands that took up the blues).  In comparison, the same isn't true for being male.  Male gender expectations have a significant impact on individuals, for example, dying at a younger age, increased risk of mental illness, being subject to the draft, higher rate of homelessness, increased risk of being the victim of violence, higher incarceration rates, earlier age of death, etc.

My main question is why don't we see a similar level (or any) negative outcomes to the majority when we're examining privilege with regard to race instead of gender?

In addition, I'm familiar with the concepts of hegemonic masculinity and toxic masculinity, however, both of these ideas appear to be inadequate attempts uphold the privilege/unilateral oppression model for gender where it doesn't really work.  Specifically, why don't we have the need for any concepts such as toxic whiteness or hegemonic whiteness?  In fact, it would seem almost silly and counter to the idea of white privilege if these concepts needed to exist in the first place.

Many of the attempts I've seen to explain the differences or the need for adding in additional qualifiers like ""toxic masculinity"" tend to come back to tying the concept of privilege only to institutional power access (or oppression to lack of access).  However, what I've failed to see anyone be able to address is why we see such different outcomes to those with ""unilateral privilege"" when we focus on access to power/privilege with regard to race and when we focus on access to power/privilege with regard to gender.  One comes with no negative impact to the in power group while the other comes with privilege in some situations and systematic disadvantages in others.

162,Do you think it's fair for men to be judged more negatively for seeking casual sex?,"Traditionally there has been(and still exists in some places) a double standard where women who sleep around are judged as ""sluts"" whereas men who sleep around are applauded. But what I am seeing today is basically the reverse. Basically there both women and men who seek casual sex. When men express interest in casually hooking up with a women, the women who are not into casual sex become outraged and judge the man as a sleazy pervert. But when women express interest casually hooking up with a man they do not get judged the same way, because men who are not into it generally do not react the same way as the woment.

It's true that the women judging the men for wanting casual sex are not the same women who are into it themselves (at least I don't think so). Basically it's that some women do casual sex with and don't judge men for doing the same while other women don't do it and judge men for it. Interestingly enough, these women generally don't seem to judge the women for seeking casual sex. In my experience, many of them straight up deny that any women are into that, claiming all women want a relationship and it's just men who are into casual sex.

0,On women asking men for help with small things,"So tonight a friend of mine posted on FB that she couldn't get a jar open (to be fair, it was a *huge* jar). Somewhere in the comments she said that she just might have to put on some lipstick and ask the handsome neighbour for help - which itself is all kinds of problematic, but not what I'm wondering about here.

Do you ever find yourselves in positions where you have little other option than to ask a man for this kind of help, and how do you feel about it? I'm realizing I sort of have my own set of expectations on how women, specifically feminists, would feel, but that's speculation and it would help to hear it from you. How much of the feeling depends on how the man being asked responds? What makes it better or worse? Or do you simply never find yourself needing to ask a man for help? Is it a non-issue altogether?

7,Reverse sexism? I’m curious to hear opinion on this situation. Job application at the fire department (uk),"This post is not meant to be derogatory in any way. It is simply a question. The post is to be kept anonymous for obvious reasons.

A client came into work &amp; told me about his day. His role is the head of recruitment at our local fire service. In the UK (and I’m sure many parts of the world) jobs at the fire department are highly desirable with many, many applicants.

In this instance the fire service received over 1000 applications for 3 new jobs. All applicants (apart from 5) were male.

They have certain requirements that each applicant must pass before going onto the next stage. One requirement being a physical test of strength. Of course, an important part of their job is lifting heavy bodies out of buildings.

Any male applicant who failed the physical test, had their application immediately dismissed. There were a considerable number of men who failed the physical test, and thus ending their application.

None of the 5 female applicants passed the physical test in this particular round.

My client informed me that he was instructed (from people above his role) to make sure one of the new employees was female. 

I have no reason to believe this client was exaggerating the truth.

This often is with respect to things like catcalling, walking alone at night, social isolation (STEM), rape, etc..

28,“Women have been taught and conditioned to **insert specific behavior here**”,"Never understood this argument that feminists use.  It isn’t long into debating a feminist that I’ll hear this line be used.  For example, let’s say the issue being talked about is gender roles.  It’ll go something like...

“Women have been conditioned by society to be submissive, passive, and polite in order to make her man feel good” or something of that nature.

Now, I’m not necessarily denying that that is true, but you know that you could just not listen to “society”, right?  Like in that argument, you’re pretty much suggesting that women have no free will, and that society’s “conditioning” makes them be a certain way whether they like it or not.  That seems pretty sexist against women if you ask me; being completely unable to think independently of what social standards dictate.

Just because there’s a social standard that says you have to be some certain way does not mean you have to comply or listen to it.  There’s this thing called free will.  I mean I was taught by “society” growing up to do a lot of things, and a lot of the time ignored it... because you can do that.  

Sure, maybe you’ll get ostracized by people by not complying to social standards, but honestly, if you care about being ostracized by people than you don’t hate whatever social standard you’re complaint about enough.  Cause if you did, you wouldn’t care.

29,Thin Privilege,"What do you think about the concept of thin privilege?  To me, this highlights a major problem with feminism.  This constant need to be portrayed as a victim.  It's now gotten to the point where healthy lifestyle choices are being condemned, and people with unhealthy lifestyle choices are demanding to be treated as a victim and given sympathy.  Being thin requires self discipline, hard work, self control, and much more.  It is something that should be thought of as a good thing, and encouraged by a healthy society.  Being overweight is very bad for your health.  Being very overweight is horrendous for your health.

Feminism is encouraging people to yearn to be considered a victim.  There is no way that can possibly be a healthy thing.  There is also this issue of lowering expectations for people, and constantly telling people that they have no control over their lives.  It's a very bad message to send to people.

32,Where does AF stand on unconscious bias retraining?,"So full disclosure, I have a complicated relationship with feminism.  I'm left wing but libertarian/individualist in outlook.  I believe strongly in equal opportunities but I find some of the things that employers and universities are doing at the moment a bit troubling.  I've also perhaps been watching one too many Jordan Peterson videos lately and I perhaps need to get a bit more balance (hence I'm here).  I suspect you guys have strong opinions about him but please don't assume I'm blindly uncritical of his opinions.

One of the things that Dr Peterson is against is unconscious bias training.  His argument is essentially three fold:

1.  He thinks the tests have a low reliability measure.  I.e. you can do them more then once and get different results.  He says that the creators of the tests have accepted this criticism and don't especially advocate their mandatory use at employers.
2.  He thinks they've been rolled out to employers before we've established what these unconscious biases really indicate.  I.e. is not clear what the relationship is between these biases and our actual behaviour.
3.  He thinks that mandatory retraining to address these biases which some HR departments are adopting could do harm.  He suggests that there's some evidence that such retraining programs can actually make people more set in their ways.  (I haven't been able to check if this is true)

I haven't yet checked the the veracity of Peterson's scientific claims, and I'm not in the field anyway so..  However, I disagree with him on the first two points.  Even if the test is a little unreliable, I don't see how an individual exploring their biases can really do much harm.  It is after all pretty self-evident that we all have them.  I also think there's no harm for employers inviting their employees to do this, although I'm not sure how I feel about it being mandatory.

However, on point 3 I think he has a stronger case.  Mandatory bias retraining does sound rather Orwellian and I know from my own experience that very often if your biases don't align with a subject you tend to remain unconvinced and even become more entrenched in your view with exposure to those views.  Echo chambers occur for a reason after all and you tend not to be able to join an echo chamber that doesn't already align with you.

So, what does AF make of his claims?  Has anyone experienced mandatory bias retraining and know what it involves?

33,Fictional settings &amp; regressive ideas,"*(TL;DR at the bottom)*

I'm a giant nerd - tabletop RPGs, vidya games, fantasy, SF, history, reading, writing - and I have great love for imaginary worlds, and spend a lot of time working on some (either mine or others'). I've been bouncing some thoughts around about the whole hobby in general, and would love to hear some other opinions and views.

Specifically, I have a thing for settings (over individual characters) that have depth &amp; verisimilitude - which is very different, to me, from accurately reflecting specific parts of reality. E.g. Glorantha (of RuneQuest/HeroQuest) is completely unrealistic, but has amazing depth and verisimilitude and variety. But I'm painfully aware from experience that people who share this taste - and history buffs in general (especially ancient/medieval) - are often pretty conservative or regressive. Frequently, calls for ""verisimilitude"" (or especially ""realism"") are a dog-whistle for wanting to see ""gritty"" sexism and racism acted out in the setting, sometimes with a hint of glee or anticipation.

The thing is, I enjoy a setting that sets up social conflicts. For instance, Mark Smylie's *Artesia*'s world (of the *Artesia* comics, the novel *The Barrow*, and the RPG *Artesia: Adventures in the Known World*) focuses on a region analoguous to Medieval Europe, dominated by an oppressively patriarchal monotheistic conquering culture; set up against it is an egalitarian-matriarchal polytheistic conquered culture. It's a pretty typical set-up, but IMO carried off so well. Almost all condemnation of the oppressive culture is diegetic (i.e. it's the characters, not the author), but there are definitely subtexts that support the condemnation (e.g. *The Barrow* includes specific trope subversions and generally has a theme of ""repressing sexuality, as a culture, causes it to fester and turn bad""). I love it. Except for Artesia's lack of pants in the first comic book, which Smylie corrected after criticism...

Similarly, I really love the imaginary Heortling culture in the Glorantha RPG setting; a general ""barbarian"" culture (with shades of Roman-era Celts, Franks, Goths, Saxons, the Norse, and many others) that has strong gender roles, but also explicitly has ways for breaking them (queens ruling over tribes, women warriors, a goddess of trans women / a third gender). The roles are obviously not something I support IRL (all gender norms/roles must be abolished), but it helps make for a deep, real-feeling setting, and sets up all kinds of conflicts players could explore. The setting also has overtly oppressively patriarchal cultures, oppressively matriarchal cultures, more egalitarian cultures, etc. (most drawing each on multiple real-world sources and broader social &amp; religious themes, rather than trying to pastiche any one thing).

For SF, I love dystopian cyberpunk settings. (And particularly SF that examines how tech can really change society, e.g. *The Diamond Age*.) For fantasy, I love getting into the details of how historical societies actually worked, because I feel like they can create eminently playable/story-rich circumstances (reflecting historical events like the Anarchy, etc.). In all cases, I do seem to prefer settings that incorporate some kind of stark inequalities between people. I almost find it... boring, I guess, to basically say ""this character is totally different, but it doesn't result in any struggle."" I'd never try to force a player to play through something they just didn't get any joy out of, or ""punish"" them or something like that (I think any roleplayer has, at a minimum, heard plenty of horror stories about game masters like that), but my first choice absolutely is to present plausible and detailed social conflicts.

And I guess the question I'm struggling with is: what does all this say about me? Am I really using fiction/games to explore social conflicts and injustices in some kind of meaningful way? Am I fetishsizing them? Am I trivializing them?

**TL;DR/coda:**

What kind of a responsibility does a writer (of a book, a movie, a game, a setting) have to condemn regressive ideas? Does it need to be explicit or non-diegetic, is it sufficient if it's diegetic or implicit, is it fine to just portray bad things and mixed reactions to them and let readers/viewers/players draw their own conclusions?",AskFeminists,1518369428,tlndfors,8,5,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7wu0t8/fictional_settings_regressive_ideas/,2018-02-11

What I haven't been able to find, though, is anything comparing the FOSS community's sexism with that of the commercial software industry. Any of you have experience with this? I wanted to believe things were better in FOSS, but what I'm reading makes me think it might actually be worse.

60,How can aid the feminist movement/be an ally without profiteering off of it?,"Hey everyone. I want to try and be a better ally/person and I was wondering if I could ask for advice? 

To give some background, I understand why I was a pretty misogynistic person in the first place. I grew up in an abusive environment. My father was someone who was the definition of toxic masculinity. I was eventually able to leave that household and go through college by myself. It took awhile but I was able to find affordable therapy. Once I went through therapy I started healing and through the healing process I was much more aware of my past behaviors. 

I never committed assault or anything of that nature, but I had pretty bad ""Nice Guy Syndrome"", trying to rely on women to fulfill my happiness, and then getting upset/demanding their time when it never worked out. 

I was wrong for doing that, and I wanted to correct my mistakes. When I started therapy it was just a flood of all the negativity I had. My therapist broke me down as a person and allowed me to be vulnerable. She brought me back up and I actually grew as a person and didn't feel damaged as anymore.

I'm not trying to get sympathy, because I know that doesn't absolve me of my actions, but I understand why I acted like that and it had a lot do with my own upbringing.

Now I'm trying to do the right thing and be a feminist ally as much as I can and support feminist movements. I've completely stopped a lot of my behaviors and I've humbled myself to listen to women and not take up their space. I want to be a feminist ally because I truly feel it's the right thing to do, but I don't want to profit off the movement like how some male celebrity feminists did.

So I wanted to know on how to reconcile that? How can I talk the talk and support the feminist movement and also walk the walk? Is it possible for me as someone who had a lot of bad behaviors to change and aid the feminist movement without being a hypocrite, and if so what's the best way I can do that without being detrimental?

61,Are there recent examples of men taking over previously female-dominated fields?,"So this question entered my head via another discussion here, but I thought it better to ask you all as a group. It's been pointed out that not only does the expected salary in a previously male-dominated industry go down as it becomes more female-dominated, but the opposite effect has been observed when men take over a female-dominated one (women became prevalent in teaching, salaries went down; men became dominant in computer programming, salaries went up). This would speak to work being devalued once it's women doing it, and perceived as more valuable when men start doing it. My difficulty with these examples is that they're pretty dated; men took over computer programming decades ago, and women did the same in teaching, and back then, I would basically expect to see that kind of gender-based valuation of work. But a great deal has changed in the past fifty years, and so I'm wondering if anyone has examples of this same principle that could be observed in, say, the last twenty years, which would demonstrate more convincingly that gender remains a factor in the valuation of work. As it stands now, the comparative salaries of teaching and computer programming have become their own status quo, and I don't know of any shift in the gender balance recently that corresponds to expected income. At this point, it's a chicken/egg matter - do women choose lower-paying fields, or are the fields women choose paid lower *because women choose them*?

Anthropologists have identified a lot of differences in social coordination based on differing practices of sexuality between species. A well known example would be the classic difference between Bonobos and Chimpanzees.

Feminist sexologist Emily Nagowski called human female desire predominantly ""responsive"" and male desire predominantly ""spontaneous"". In an AMA on her blog a couple of years ago, she said: ""It’s not the difference in desire alone that does [create gender problems]. It takes a lot of other dynamics. But the desire difference is definitely a component, I think.""

https://web.archive.org/web/20160320223042/http://www.thedirtynormal.com/blog/2014/07/12/an-awesome-question/

So here's my question - to which extent do you / feminism / a certain kind of feminism consider differences in the human desire - based on parental investment or on ""patriarchy"", on nurture or nature or both to some degree - to be an important variable for social organisation?

Particularly with respect to female agency, and desire and the male reaction to it (making things circular rather than unidirectional male-&gt;female, as some ideas about patriarchy suggest). 

There's so many feminists saying that patriarchy hurts men, too, that men would live longer and better under ""non-patriarchy"" (in the largest possible definition), but it seems to me that they are, in saying so, disregarding that male competition for female sexuality is usually higher than female competition for male sexuality (I would argue due to self-evident biological constraints but that's just me). Life expectancy for men equals that of women only in monasteries, where there is not usually mating competition.

Ignoring the influence of female desire for male behavior may, of course, be intentional, as it takes focus of the social structure being critizised. 

But disregarding that possibility for the sake of the question, is there a feminist argument about female desire and its influence on male mate choice / strategizing?

Or is that simply not a permitted line of thinking among (blank slate?) social constructivists/feminists/which kind of feminists?

64,"I'm curious about feminist responses to the statement ""Men are generally far superior to women at athletic pursuits."" Is this considered misogynistic? (I'm asking in full sincerity and seriousness.)","I was watching the Olympics and was *blown away* by the performance of Chloe Kim in the women's freestyle snowboarding event. She is 17 and is an amazing athlete—she is 10x the snowboarder I, a man, could ever dream of being even if I devoted my entire life to snowboarding.

The next night, Shaun White competed in the same freestyle snowboarding event. Even to a non-expert spectator, Mr. White was **clearly** superior to Ms. Kim in **every** aspect of his performance—He went faster, flew higher, did more spins and flips, etc.

It's just like this in every sport I can think of in which men and women both compete: Basketball, tennis, swimming, weight lifting, track &amp; field, soccer, etc., etc. etc. (The one exception I've heard of is long distance swimming??)

I'm curious if feminists realize these differences and agree to a statement like: ""Men are generally far superior to women at athletic pursuits?""

Or is this considered sexist and ""wrong"" to say?

67,Do you think marriage should disappear as an institution and the legal benefits you get from them ?,"Hello!

I was wondering if feminists think that marriage should just disappear and any legal benefits that come from being married (there are some in my country but don't know about US or other parts).

Also do you believe that prenups should not be needed after marriage disappears and whatever is acquired during the ""partnership"" of two people should reflect the owner(s) in the property document. When the two partners decide to go their separate ways they should just be able to claim only the things that have their name on it.

I am asking because at least in the past I heard a lot of cases where X star/famous person cheated on his Y partner and the Y partner got $ 10MIL or some crazy amount like that in the divorce.

In my country you don't even have to be married to have a claim on your partners property.

I am not going to link people in the OP, as I do not want to draw undo attention. But basically, it was claimed that women are superior in ""flexibility, balance, coordination, stamina, and grace."" Based on the research, the only point that this is true for is flexibility. THe research on stamina is questionable [see here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2017-08-29-reports-that-women-have-more-stamina-look-a-little-weak/) and on fine motor function, men and women appear identical by all the research I can find (which would cover balance, coordination and ""grace"").

70,Was it correct for Google to fire James Damore?,"His argument was basically that there's probably biological causes that explain populational, normal distribution differences in the interests of men and women in tech and that striving for 50% representation may be unrealistic given that men and women might not naturally sort themselves that way without social engineering to ofset their natural desires.

He then goes on to suggest that discriminatory affirmative action approaches are counterproductive and potentially cause resentment, and that individualistic interventions might be a better way of finding women that are genuinely suited to tech.

Now, I accept that some scientists have said he's right about the biological differences and some have said he's not.  I'm not a scientist so I don't have a view.  My real question was do you think it's right that he was fired?  He's pretty clear that women can be great programmers so I'm unclear why his memo was so controversial.  

Is it that the idea that men and women might not be biologically identical at the group level which causes so much of the controversy?  I've been reading recently that there's an inverse relationship between how progressive a society is and how many women enter the STEM field.  With India having the highest proportion and the Scandinavian countries the lowest.  That seems strong evidence to me that the more free women's choices are (from their parents influence presumably) the less likely they are to choose a career in engineering.

&gt;In North Carolina, if an assault is committed against a male, the perpetrator (whether male or female) is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. But if a male over 18 years of age commits an assault on a female, it is a Class A1 misdemeanor (the same classification as when a person inflicts serious injury upon another person or uses a deadly weapon). N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-33. This difference in classification means that male defendants who assault females receive greater sentences than defendants of either gender who assault males.

72,How do I make this a teachable moment for my daughter?,"Today my 6 year old daughter (we'll call her Sally) bent over in class and a boy who was sitting close by (we'll call him Johnny) kissed her butt. She told the teacher and Johnny was put in time out. A note didn't come home with Sally about the incident. She told her dad and her dad told me. (We're divorced and it's his weekend). I was on my way home from work so I stopped by the after school program that both kids attend so I could speak with the director regarding this incident. Johnny was being picked up by his mom at the time and the director, his mom and I sat down together and I told them what happened. Then the Johnny was brought over and told us flat out what happened. The director asked things like ""did you do something you shouldn't have"" and ""did you do something that may have upset sally"" to which Johnny responded ""I kissed Sally's butt"". The director explained to him how serious this was and how he can't do things like this. I also explained to little Johnny that I knew he was a good boy and made a bad choice and from there he erupted into tears. Johnny's mom was very apologetic and explained that she would be working with him on his behavior. As I left the director told me I should be contacting his teacher regarding this incident or else she would on my behalf. We agreed that Johnny and Sally should remain separated while they are in the after school program. 

Sally is very sensitive and in tune with her emotions and I worry that if I bring this up when she comes home Sally will resist discussing it because it will make it her emotional and uncomfortable.

79,Bullied at school for being a Male feminist,"Hey guys, recently with the feminist movement I feel happy for oppressed woman and support the feminist movement for equal rights among genders. That’s all cool except for one tiny problem. I’m a guy.  My school has an approximate 1:1.5 girls to guys ratio. I support feminism because from where I am, Singapore, though girls are allowed to study, do stuff males can do, there is still some gender bias present in our society. Such as job promotions and cliques. Some of my classmates treat girls like crap sometimes and they come running back to them because their popular guys and to stand up against them would mean to be ostracised. I see this and feel pity for the girls and will stand up for them. But the guys love pick on me on the most trivial matters and say I’m a male feminist due to the “thirst for pu*sy”. I’m never selected with the guys for PE teams, can’t sit at their table during lunch or recess and basically get the “your unwelcome” feel. I do have a group of female friends I can count on. Their really nice to me and just because I’m a guy they don’t hate on me and treat me just like any of them. I feel accepted in that group but I just can’t help but wonder. Why do some girls give up their dignity to be abused by guys? And is there a counter or reply I can give back to those guys who love picking on me just because I support feminism?

80,"I'm a libertarian, why do feminists tend to be more liberal/big-government and welfare? Wouldn't total (or nearly total) free-market capitalism be the best way to eradicate any economic oppression of women?","Let's assume James Damore is completely wrong about everything and therefore women and men on average have the exact same biological capacity and interest for every field of work. Consider an economy of nearly total free-market capitalism and very low government regulation of wages, hiring rules, and barriers to starting new businesses. Suppose I were a sexist and I believed (consciously or unconsciously) that women are worse at/don't belong in STEM fields and STEM jobs (we could extend this to other fields and economic tranches, but just using STEM as an example). What am I really going to do to keep women down?


Maybe I'll start my own software/tech company and refuse to hire women. Or maybe hire women but suppress their wages and refuse to promote them (either through conscious policing or unconscious bias at the upper levels). But how would that really oppress women as a whole in STEM fields? If women are truly just as good men (on average) in STEM fields and in the workforce as a whole (work ethic, competitiveness, desire to achieve higher positions, etc) then my sexist company will lose in the long run by not hiring or not equally promoting women. Because if we assume there are an equal proportion of talented STEM women as there are men, then by being sexist my tech company is at a competitive disadvantage because my sexism is making my company miss out on 50% of the talented programmers. So if women are truly just as good in STEM fields then free-market forces would (in the long run) punish sexist tech companies when all the talented STEM women choose to work for companies that treat them equally (or start their own companies). If I literally refused to hire women, that would happen pretty fast since I'd be stopping my company from using any talent potential from STEM women and severely limiting my options for growth. If I subtly suppressed women (not promoting them, not giving them good projects or mentoring, etc) then it might take longer, but eventually women will realize that my company suppresses them and work for a different company (or start their own, since that would be so easy in a free market) and the same result will follow. If my tech company treats women unequally in a totally free market, while women are in fact just as equally good in tech, then that's an inefficiency that will hurt my company in the long run. The only way these kinds of inefficiencies from sexism could go on for decades and decades is because of government forces and regulations that distort incentives, slow down the economy, and screw with people identifying and acting in rational self-interest.


Now, you might claim that ALL of men/society (or a significant enough majority) hold these kinds of sexist beliefs that suppress women economically. Thus, it's really not a free market for women because no matter what tech company a woman tries to work for she will always be treated unequally (or at least have a very high chance of being treated so). And tech companies started or run by women won't be taken as seriously and will lose because all/majority of men hold these kinds of sexist Anti-STEMWomen beliefs. Thus, government involvement is needed to protect and promote the interests of women.


But if it is really true that the majority of men/society are that sexist, I would argue that feminists DEFINITELY do not want large government involvement or expansive state powers. Because if the majority of people are sexist, then we'll all be voting for sexist politicians and supporting sexist policies and applying government power to suppress women. So in a society of mass misogyny, women should want total freedom even more because a massively misogynistic population would elect a massively misogynistic government to further oppress women in the economy.",AskFeminists,1518977173,bradfucius,95,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7yfza7/im_a_libertarian_why_do_feminists_tend_to_be_more/,2018-02-18

87,why don't feminists criticize modesty culture ?,"feminists in the west are so upset about the sexualization of women and are actively criticizing societal norms that they see are harmful to women as it values them based on how much attractive they are, feminists have for long discussed makeup, high heels and how much pressure the society can put on women to wear them. feminists have criticized movies and games presenting women in over-sexualizing  manner because they believe that it contributes to objectification.

in general feminists are very alarmed about sexualization in the west, it certainly takes a huge portion of their concentration and efforts today

but when it comes to modesty culture, we hear no criticism, and those who dare to criticize it are seen and treated as outcasts. which doesn't sit right at all for me. it wouldn't have been much of an issue if modesty culture was foreign to them or if it wasn't highlighted, but today we already have a major intellectual movement with hundreds of million of followers around the globe that are promoting and theorizing for it. we already have modesty culture implemented in tens of countries around the world,and we already have communities in the west with same mindset and views regarding it, so it is certainly highlighted to them, yet we don't have many strong reactions. in fact all i'm seeing is 
 a celebration of it.

for some reason western feminist don't think that views that deems the female body sexually inappropriate problematic or even questionable, despite that those views encourage sexualization of women, if someone said that good women should be sexy all the time so men may enjoy their bodies feminists would certainly rage against the one who is saying that, and they would certainly rage against women who are convinced by that.but when they encounter  cultures out there with the mindset that women should be covered in front of men so that men don't get aroused by their sight, or just because it is a form of degeneracy or immorality, you hear no reaction.

and generally, i'm not sure whether the idea that the female form is inherently shameful to be revealed at public when the male form is completely accepted and normalized is not problematic. or that it isn't a form of inequality that feminists should criticize.

the amount of sophistry and bizarre games of language and relativism that feminists use to come to the conclusion that such beliefs aren't worthy of criticism is certainly a source of  amazement, especially if you considered how much women in such cultures are valued primarily based on how much pure and modest they are and how in such cultures there is a little to no agency when it comes to sexuality or dress.

so, why does this double standards exist ? are cultures that base women's value on their purity and modesty inherently better than cultures that base women's value on how much attractive they are even the if the pressures and the importance of both of them were different in each cultures ( i'ven't honestly heard of women being killed because they aren't sexy enough  or because they don't engage in pre-marital sex, or families and husbands forcing their women to show boobs or legs, or some kind of reverse victim blaming directed at women who aren't sexy)

I've met the parents of a trans child, I have trans relatives and have watched a significant portion of transgendered children on Youtube. 

After some thought though, I wonder if there aren't some inherently problematic ideas that arise when looking at transgendered children from a feminist POV, to wit: 

* I've seen and met parents of gender non-conforming children and many of them beam with pride at the non-typical 'hobbies' of their children. I've been told that from the youngest age a trans girl loved playing with cars, video games and ""hated Barbies"". 
* Watch any program on TV regarding trans children and you will find a similar sentiment; trans children start demonstrating traits of their 'preferred gender' very young, oft-times from a pre-verbal stage if they are to be believed. 
* There is [legitimate research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexuality) that is uncovering links between neurochemistry, hormonal composition and incidence of non-typical sexual identity. 

All of this is perfectly fine in my books. Individuals who are transgendered are examples of the diversity of humans. What worries me are people who pretend that these difference don't exist? 

Think of it like this; I have met (and can name) feminists on this sub who hold the belief that gender is merely a social construct: that most or all gender roles are a mere artifice of the patriarchy. If that were the case, then it leads to the worrying corollary - **the parents are responsible for their child's non-typical sexual identity**

When I say ""worrying"", I mean it is worrying because of the associated stigma and co-morbid mental dysfunction associated with trans identity. 

It seems to me that by saying that gender norms are merely socially constructed flies directly in the face of the evidence, trans people being particular exemplars of this. 

What is your POV on the topic? Do you think that transgendered kids are influenced by their parents or is it deeper and innate?

 I think trans people should be taught with respect, so no need adding that in your response. ",AskFeminists,1519008700,industrialbrainclean,8,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7yjk0w/transgender_children_and_feminism/,2018-02-18

92,Attempted labeling as a rapist for disagreeing.,"So this happened over the weekend. To be clear I'm not interested in debating the issue as fairly certain I know the stance taken on it here and that I most likely disagree with the majority stance here. Which is perfectly fine for me. I'd really like to get opinions on the events following to get an idea of what is considered reasonable. I will include parts of my stance as they may be relevant to your opinions on the behavior. Again. Not looking to argue. Just looking for opinions and maybe a few follow up questions!

So I am part of a social group that has nothing to do with politics and politics is never really discussed inside of this group. Nor should it be as it can really create some strong divides in people that otherwise get a long quite well. The topic of rape culture came up and was being discussed fairly one sided amongst a few select members of the group in our community kik group. I mentioned that my opinion on this topic would not be liked, but they continued this conversation in this group chat so, being myself and not really up for one sided conversation about something I disagree with, began to express my opinion as well.

My opinion really rested entirely on that I did think our culture saw rape as an acceptable as a practice, though I agreed on all points on what constitutes rape and that the punishments for those people should be much more severe. The real point of trouble seemed to be in accusation. My feelings toward accusations is that accusation, regardless of how many shouldn't be considered evidence in court. I also mentioned I thought it unfair that we as a society will take these accusations(for murder as well) and make up our mind and treat these possibly innocent people as if they are what they have beenaccused of.

This resulted in one person calling me a rapist, in so many words, and calling my sense of morality and ability to make appropriate sexual decisions regarding to consent into question. Keep in mind I have been in intimate and compromising situations with this person's and several other females in this group. I have been a preferred person for the activities we do and have never once done or been accused of anything bordering on sexual harassment, rape or abusive behavior. My understanding of consent is fairly strong and I've been known to go out of my way to make people feel comfortable both around me and in situations in the group. 

Now all but one woman in the group disagreed with my stance which absolutely acceptable. About half of these women reached out to me and said while I disagree I don't think you've done another wrong the other half has pushed towards the leaders of these group labeling me as unsafe and a possible rapist. However the group leader fell in the half that disagrees but sees no issue. 

I've sense left the group to distance myself from these people. I'm not really  fond of drama or what I find to be unreasonable anger. 

So now that I've put out a large poorly structure context. Do you feel that it is reasonable or acceptable behavior for these women to attack my character when it has been observed to be acceptable?",AskFeminists,1519061735,GreyMatterDisturbed,44,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7yodli/attempted_labeling_as_a_rapist_for_disagreeing/,2018-02-19

94,What are your thoughts and views on married women choosing to keep their last names? Is it patriarchal for a woman to adopt her husband's last name?,"So I've been thinking about feminism and marriage recently and I noticed that there is a growing number of women choosing to not take their husband's last names (for opposite-sex marriages). I noticed that married couples from younger generations are opting for the four of the following choices...

1. Wife and or husband take on hyphenated last names

* John Smith-Mendoza and Christine Smith-Mendoza

2. ""Meshed"" or combined last names

* John Semoza and Christine Semoza

3. Husband takes wife's last name

* John Mendoza and Christine Mendoza

4. Husband and wife opt to have different last names.

* John Smith and Christine Mendoza

I did some thinking and I realize that some women choose to not take their husband's last name because it is patriarchal and even oppressive. Do some feminist women opt to keep their last names because they don't like the sexist attitudes behind it.

However other feminist women gladly take their husband's last name since they believe that feminism is about making choices and that if they are happy taking their husband's last name, then they don't find anything wrong with that choice.

Personally, I think people should be free to choose whatever option works best for them. What may work for me may not work for someone else. Would I take my wife's last name if I were to get married? At this time, I am not sure. There is a stigma towards men taking their wive's last names but people shouldn't let stigma stop them from doing what's best for them.

So that is my view. I am hoping to start a brief discussion about this so that I can open myself to various viewpoints.",AskFeminists,1519074528,Questyman,36,1,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7yq6j9/what_are_your_thoughts_and_views_on_married_women/,2018-02-19

100,Mothers vs fathers physical child abuse,"Studies have shown that mothers commit a lot more physical abuse towards their children than fathers. 

DHHS data in the UK shows that of children abused by one parent between 2001 and 2006, 70.6 per cent were abused by their mothers, 29.4 per cent were abused by their fathers.

Breaking the silence, for instance, says 71 per cent of children killed by one parent are killed by their mothers, 60 per cent of those victims are boys.

This clearly goes completely against the current stereotype about how men are the violent maniacs, and women are peaceful people trying to reign in those violent men.  And how women are always the victims and are never responsible for any of the bad in the world.  What do you think about these statistics?  And I know people on here are going to try to use the excuse that women do most of the parenting, so it makes sense that they would hit their kids more.  But it really doesn't, since so much is talked about how perfect women are, and how violent men are.  You would think women wouldn't ever hit their kids, if you listened to the mainstream narrative.  What is your opinion on all of this?  And do you think the mainstream narrative about peaceful, innocent women should go away?

108,How important is for feminism to get male allies ?,"I was having a debate with a woman friend of mine who is a feminist and presenting some opinions/suggestions regarding how to grow the number of male feminists.

After being told that my opinion on feminism does not matter as I am a male and feminists don't have to listen to me, she told me that getting allies is not one of the feminism's main goals.

[She even made a ""nice"" analogy about how I could be compared to a janitor in a company and that the CEO (the feminists) would not take advice or listen to the opinion of a janitor on how to increase sales. I told her that a smart CEO would listen to anyone who would show the interest in the company so much as to spend their time to think of ways to improve sales. If the idea is bad you just move one.]

Now my first question is, how important it really is to get male allies to join the feminist movement ?

My second question is: In your opinion do you have to be a feminist to support equality? As a male do you have to agree with all the ideas of feminism in order to be able to say that you support equality ?

109,Feminism and dating,"Hello,

This question is especially for the women feminists.

I found an article on OkCupid (yes...yes maybe not the most reliable source) that showed that although 77% of women on the website identify as feminists, 45% still like to be pursued by men and only 1% said that they would like to be the ones pursuing.

The other 54% said that they like a little bit of both.

My question here is does this apply to you? Where do you stand on this as a woman feminist?

And if you like to be pursued instead of the other way around, which other traditional gender roles are you ok with (if any).

Thank you!

2,Women in Cryptocurrency,"Recently I have read an article [1] that states that almost all users of Bitcoin are male. Being a user of cryptocurrencies myself, I was pretty sure that there was a male majority in this industry but I’m quite surprised that the disparity is this vast.

A little more digging around and I have found that most (if not all?) of the dozens of Bitcoin developers are also male. This is just a statistic and developer population does not necessarily indicate user population, but it is interesting nonetheless.

Are women being discouraged from entering the cryptocurrency space? I thought that maybe it could be because women have less access to funds to invest, however the stock market discrepancy isn’t as large as the Bitcoin discrepancy so Im not sure if that is the case.

As someone very interested in crypto, this is pretty disappointing to me as one of the main reasons why crypto is fascinating to me is because it is not tied to a person, but rather an address, so I thought that it would be free from discrimination of gender unlike most in-person financial industries.

3,"""You guys"" is gender neutral where I am, but the singular ""guy"" is not. Is this OK/should this be done with?","I'm going to ask /r/asklinguistics as well, since I think it might also give another good perspective.  I will provide background.

I am from the San Francisco Bay Area.  Where I am, I can refer to a group of 10 women or so (generally young women - I wouldn't speak so casually to a group of older women) as ""you guys"" without the presence of a single guy in them.  Nobody would bat an eye.  This cannot be done in reverse: referring to a group of men as ""ladies"" or something or other would be a jesting jab at best.  This is regional: I am aware that this is not acceptable everywhere, and I have no idea how it came into being.

In other languages, this is grammatically standard.  In French, for instance, if you have a group of people with even 1 man and as many women as you want, or a group of people of no certainty of gender determination, you would refer to the masculine plural, which is often thought of as the ""default"".  ""Les americains"", for instance, would be the Americans and could be used to refer to any group of Americans unless they were all women, in which case it would be ""les americaines"".  A similar thing can be found in Spanish: ""ellos"" is the default third person plural, with the feminine ""ellas"" only used when referring to a third plural party of all women (or nouns of a feminine grammatical gender).  English does not have grammatical gender outside of referring to people.

On the one hand, it's natural and I don't know anyone around here who is offended by it.  On the other hand, I can see why it would be annoying since it doesn't work the other way around.  If someone genuinely didn't mean anything offensive but thought it would be easier to refer to me by a feminine aspect, I wouldn't care despite being a man.

4,question about #metoo,"I think the movement is great, and important, but here's what bothers me, and I'd love to know what you think. Led by men, society is utterly obsessed with women in their teens and 20s, and I feel like metoo is both reacting to that obsession (and the harassment that follows from it) but also perpetuating it a bit --maybe? 

Sexual harassment can happen at any age, but for most women it drops off drastically after our 20s/early 30s, making it a very small period of a woman's 80 year lifespan. I've been sexually harassed (a man in a position of power exposed himself to me, then threatened me), but I've been much more harmed and hurt by the ways that men have belittled me and tried not to accept my leadership in the workplace. And there's no cutoff age for that -- it is ongoing, and probably even gets worse with age and increasing responsibility in the workplace. 

I guess it just disturbs me a bit that other aspects of sexism that affect women for much longer have never gained anywhere near this kind of traction.

13,Can a humane goal be achieved by using inhumane means?,"Hi all, 
this is a question that has been stuck in my head for quite some time. I have to say, I don't identify as feminist and by the standards of this subreddit I'm not ( I don't believe in the patriarchy). In my eyes the most vocal part of the feminist community has taken a rather totalitarian political approach. Coming from Eastern Europe and the years living under oppression left me with really cynical view the socialist movement of all things done ""for the good of others"". This led to my belief that all self proclaimed socialist,  are always one of the two types: ""useful idiots"" - people who have their heart in the right place and genuinely want to help others, and in turn have been manipulated by the second type - the professional socialists/humanists, who are opportunistic liars and sociopaths, employing and hijacking the good intentions of the first group for their personal gain. My point is that its disturbing how mainstream feminism has adopted a lot of the totalitarian political methods. The dogma, the constant need of an enemy, having a permanent excuse for everything wrong with today's world (I'm stretching a bit here, but reading mainstream feminist media really leaves that impression on me, its hard to not draw a parallel between the patriarchy and the transition from socialism to communism, that was used to explain all issues in the countries behind the iron curtain.  ), the revanchism. 
Why?
Feminists are supposed to be the good guys, fighting on the right side. Why are there so many examples of feminists actively avoiding discourse? This is one of the few places online where I've seen actual meaningful and fruitful conversations. (maybe I'm not searching right for others).  Here is an example http://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/04/27/sex-robots-epitomize-patriarchy-offer-men-solution-threat-female-independence/ I don't have much of a problem with the article itself, but in the comments the author is labeling any opposing view as sexist, misogynistic and/or stupid or worse.

15,Thoughts on the concept and significance of female friendship?,"Hello!

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on something that's been on my mind lately. I'm still kind of solidifying these ideas and have trouble fully articulating them, so please let me know if you'd like clarification on anything.

Throughout my teenage years and into my early twenties, a lot of my social life has revolved around ""girls nights."" The actual activities have changed over the years (when I was younger it would be things like doing each other's nails and talking about our crushes) but the general spirit has stayed the same: it's a small group of close friends who feel comfortable sharing intimate details of our lives and complaining about sexism without having to deal with the ""not all men are like that"" response. It's a very loving, supportive, judgement-free zone, and that's typically my favorite way to spend time with my close friends. I'm also a serial monogamist, and these nights also serve as time away from my partner and a place to candidly tell my friends about my relationship and how it's going.

I also went to a girls' school when I was 11-13, and I was in a women's singing group in college. I've always loved the feelings of connectedness I've gotten from communities of women, and the singing group in particular was extremely important to me and a huge driving force in me becoming a more passionate and active feminist.

But in the last couple years, I've been thinking more and more about how gender impacts my friendships and social life. As I've grown older, I've come out as bisexual, learned more about the experiences of trans people and non-binary people, and have just generally been more aware of the gender spectrum and the fluidity and diversity within it. However, the concept of female friendship has been very important to me, and that feels at odds with my desire to be inclusive and supportive of people of all genders. I also have a lot of trouble pinning down exactly what I value so much in ""female friendship,"" what that precisely means to me, and how much of that feeling—what I would describe as a special kind of closeness—is related to gender and how much of it isn't.

My best friend's partner is genderqueer, was assigned female at birth, and is usually assumed to be a woman by strangers. I was hanging out with them, and they told me about a night when they and my friend had dinner with one of my friend's coworkers, and the coworker referred to that night as a ""girls night."" Obviously, that made them feel really uncomfortable because that statement misgenders them. 

That conversation made me think about my own love of girls nights and how my friend's partner fits into that. I would never call it a ""girls night"" if I knew they'd be coming, because they're not a woman and I know that (I also rarely use that phrase anymore regardless). However, the *feeling* I get when I hang out with a bunch of female friends is still there when my friend's partner is there. I'm confused about this because it feels like that means I'm invalidating their gender or that I subconsciously feel like they're a woman. And it goes back to my questions about what makes a space *feel* like a women's space or a friendship *feel* like a female friendship. I wonder if I still get those feelings when hanging out with my friend's partner because they were AFAB, have a traditionally feminine name, and present as fairly feminine, and if that's an internal bias I still need to work through.

Additionally, I have a genderqueer friend who was AMAB, and they feel invalidated when their female friends *don't* invite them along because it makes them feel like their friends think of them as a guy. So I know this is a nuanced thing and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. I just want to be inclusive and respectful of everyone.

**tl;dr**: how do you feel about the concept of ""female friendship?"" Does it feel special in any way to you, and if so, what specifically causes that feeling? And how does that concept and the feelings that go along with it coexist with people with non-binary gender identities? Is it an outdated concept that has harmful effects—something from my childhood I'm holding onto and need to let go of?

18,Do Feminists take the Handmaid's Tale Seriously as a potential future of the United States?,"
I've been reading a lot of articles and watching a lot of interview by Margaret Atwood. She makes it pretty clear that she wrote this book after doing research on 17th Century New England Puritanism. She thinks that these people weren't some sort of English style Taliban, and that the modern American culture is based on them. 

I've made a collection of some quotes and collections from her articles' she's written explaining her take, as a Canadian, on the United States when she wrote the Handmaid's tale. I don't think she actually knew anything about Puritanism when she wrote this book.

Please feel free to copy and paste the 

&gt;""The deep foundation of the US – so went my thinking – was not the comparatively recent 18th-century Enlightenment structures of the republic, with their talk of equality and their separation of church and state, but the heavy-handed theocracy of 17th-century Puritan New England, with its marked bias against women, which would need only the opportunity of a period of social chaos to reassert itself.""

The most important founding fathers of the US, like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, were Southerners who were deists from Anglican families that had no connection to Puritanism in New England. Alexander Hamilton was from the Caribbean. Not puritan remotely. 


&gt;""She tells Mead, “The legacy of witch hunting, and the sense of shame that it engendered is an enduring American blight.”"" (talking about Salem Witch Trials""

She has no context here. An estimated total of 40,000-60,000 women were executed in witch trials across Britain and Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries also. Where is this enduring European shame? Why does she think the modern US has some specific shame here even though they killed a fraction of a fraction of the number of women?

&gt;""And the regime is wiping out little pockets of resistant Baptists here and there. And stringing up nuns, etc.""

The Southern baptists here are the fundamentalists christians she wrote this book about to begin with in the Reagan administration. They have no connection to puritanism, New England, or New England Puritanism.

&gt;""Only one of the judges ever apologized for the witch trials, and only one of the accusers ever apologized,” she said.""

And he that one accuser who apologized was a man. It was the female accusers who didn't apologize. And most of the accusers were all women themselves. And many of the people accused of being witches and executed in the Salem Witch trials were men.  

&gt;""One of the keys to America is that your neighbor may be a Communist, a serial killer, or in league with satanic forces,” Atwood said. “You really don’t trust your fellow-citizens very much.”""

Any American feminists agree know what she's talking about? This isn't even feminist, but just looks like anti-Americanism. She really believes this.


&gt;""The group-activated hangings, the tearing apart of human beings, the clothing specific to castes and classes, the forced childbearing and the appropriation of the results, the children stolen by regimes and placed for upbringing with high-ranking officials, **the forbidding of literacy, the denial of property rights**: all had precedents, and many were to be found not in other cultures and religions, but within western society, and within the ""Christian"" tradition, itself.

She doesn't seem to know much about Puritansim. The 17th Century New England Puritanism were the first English group to build schools everywhere and passed laws fining parents who didn't teach their children, both boys and girls, to read.

Also, she's ironically set her book in a dystopian America where the state runs all the shops and denies property rights. She's a Green Party activist accusing America of being communist in the future. This just seem disinengous and contrived. It doesn't even make sense as speculative future take on the US from its hyper-capitalist present.

&gt;""Since the regime operates under the guise of a strict Puritanism, these women are not considered a harem, intended to provide delight as well as children. They are functional rather than decorative.""

It's not Strict puritanism if you have sex with a woman you're not married to. That's the opposite of puritanism.

&gt;""The second was my study of 17th and 18th-century America, again at Harvard, which was of particular interest to me since many of my own ancestors had lived in those times and in that place.""

Notice, how she plays it off ""many of my ancestors had lived in those times and in that place"". She's admitting her ancestors were these very puritan theocratic cultists she's criticizing as a uniquely American thing. These are her people.

Also, she seems to have forgotten a slight detail about how England itself in the 17th Century had a Puritan military dictatorship ruled by Oliver Cromwell. Even the old country was doing this at the time but she specifically thinks that these puritans made a ""Deep foundation"" on America.

19,Has the Canadian government gone too far in mandating support for reproductive rights?,"As a preface, I am vehemently pro-choice to the extent that I have a lot of trouble seeing how anyone could possible have any other position than pro-choice.

However I am also an atheist, so I am aware that I have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to religious rights.

A few weeks ago I found the YouTube channel ""ExtraCredits"". They mainly do videoessay-style videos about videogamedesign, history and science fiction with a lot of insiderjokes thrown in . The video is based on the narrator Dan who does the talking and pictures that show what is being talked about. That by itself is nothing special, but they do some things that are:

1. In the ""backgroundpictures"" when they show for example a gamer or a game dev or a journalist they have a pretty diverse cast of characters. Black and white people, men and women, people of all ages, nonbinary people. And they always encourage a inclusive gamer community and it works, their youtubecommunity is probably the most wholesome I have ever seen.

2. The criticise and search for new perspectives pretty often. They for example have videos about racism and sexism in videogames, representation in videogames, propaganda games etc. Also sometimes they make a video about the videogame industry in certain countries like Brazil and show how the culture, politics and current social infrastructure influence the art/media from said countries.

3. They find topics that are oftentimes excluded from the mainstream. For their historyseries for example they picked up the stories of Hiawatha, Mary Seacole and Mary Anning.

designing good characters is hard.

when i set out to design the characters for AVARIA, i had already made some big decisions about the lore. one being that the humanoid looking species on AVARIA is called the Hume and they are very similar to Earth Humans except that Humes are incredibly beautiful. their extreme perfection is due to their use of Mana flowing from AVARIA. 

they have perfect skin, impossible proportions, youth-like beauty.

so when it came to design Arisa, our “bad” Mage, i already had an image in my head of a “sleek, catlike, anime-looking badass female assassin in a spandex suit” kind of character.

as we were working through the concept, someone on our team posed the question: “is she too sexy?” i had never thought about that question. i immediately searched for references of “sexy” female characters. i posted photos of widowmaker from overwatch, Fran from FF12, i even reminded everyone of the tracer victory pose controversy. i thought, “if overwatch, which is praised for it’s diversity and inclusionary character design, has a woman in a spandex suit, why can’t AVARIA have one?”

in the end, we made a few minor adjustments to show a little less skin but the original concept was essentially realized in the final model. 

so now that she’s done, i’m wondering what you think. are characters like this harmful to women or anyone else? it’s fiction, does it matter? is it JUST entertainment?

I consider myself someone who supports gender equality and would like some feedback from feminists.

30,Question about relationship responsibilities,"Disclaimer: I posted this on a relationship subreddit but I think it applies to this one as well since I am more interested in what it means to be equal in a relationship (with respect to my specific situation). I want to know other feminists' points of view since I don't have a lot of friends with strong beliefs in feminism. 

I don't need direct relationship advice since if I knew what is right in this situation I'd know what action to take - whether to fix my issue or to address it with my girlfriend (or somewhere in between).

---------------

Context first - it's gonna be long but I think it's necessary to understand my situation.

My girlfriend is from a North-European country while I'm from a East-European country. Needless to say, she lived in a much more progressive world while I was brought up in a very patriarchal society. 

Still, I never shared the average POV in my country that the men are tough, non-emotional, desiring sex, beer and not much else while women are supposed to stay in the kitchen and make her bf / husband happy by cooking and giving them blowjobs (only a slight exaggeration unfortunately).

I always meant and I still mean to treat women equally and I'm an avid advocate for feminism and women's rights. That being said, I was ignorant about many things that women face in their every day lives.

At the beginning of our relationship we had many fights about what it means to truly be equal. After lots of reflection and inner fighting, I usually came to the conclusion that she's right. Emotional labor is complex and takes a lot of thoughtfulness and mental effort. One has to be attentive and care about many details to provide emotional labor for others. 

I was making, for example, the argument that ""I am just not that good at cooking and so I shouldn't be asked to do it"". That is in hindsight me being taught that the man ""cannot cook"" and that it's the woman's job. I've been taught so by my parents indirectly - my mom was always the one to think about what to eat, she was the only one cooking while my dad basically wasn't able to buy groceries when given a list, let alone think of that list for himself; I've been taught by TV - the countless shows that portray men as goofy in the kitchen, the women treating cooking as their duty to the family; ... and so on.

I also learned from my girlfriend what it means to actually put in emotional effort into a relationship. I knew about it but I didn't realise how much work it involves. I slowly taught myself to be more mindful of things in the house and things that she cares about. I understand now that taking the trash after she told me 5 times is not helping that much. 

If she has to care about everything, she is still carrying all the responsibility and that is not fair. I should do all these tiny things on my own and that's what I'm doing.

-----------

My point is, I think I've learned what it means to truly be equal. I take lots of responsibility in the house (especially since she works in an office and I work from home) and I'm happy to do so. I want to make her life easy just like she is doing the same for me. 

Everything is basically perfect except for the fact that she wants me to take charge of cooking and making sure we have (cooked) food. It might not be all the time but sometimes she gets angry at me for not doing it. To be clear, I DON'T think wanting cooked food is unreasonable. When we're lazy, we have periods of time when we eat frozen pizzas or take-out and after a while I also get tired of it and want real food.

The problem is that we have different expectations about food. She is not picky per se but she does like good food and goes through much more effort than me in having it. I could eat meatballs with mashed potatoes for a week if that meant I could use my time and effort in other ways than finding recipes and cooking.

She says that that is just me finding excuses for shoving the responsilbity upon her but I don't agree. I find good enjoyable but if given the choice I'll almost always choose shittier food and having more time doing something else than spending it on cooking.

This is where the previous context is important - I think that if she is (more) passionate about eating good food it's her responsibility to think of dishes she likes and take charge of the cooking process (I do help as much as I can, 99% of the time). I take charge of many things during our daily lives and I don't think having 1 item that I just don't care about makes me a bad person. I can still provide eating solutions but they'll usually be of less quality or contain less effort - buying some frozen pizza, getting take-out, etc.

What are your thoughts on this? I want to know if I'm just making excuses for myself or if she is demanding too much from me.

----------------

TLDR: I want to have a life with my girlfriend in which we are as equal as possible. I want to provide emotional labor for her and I believe I'm doing that. She also agrees that I'm good at doing that. Still, she demands that I be more thoughful about cooking and providing cooked food but I hate spending so much time on it when I'd be fine with eating shittier food than she would be ok with.

36,Is it possible for someone to prove that they obtained affimative consent?,"Recently, there was a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7r4szs/do_you_think_there_should_be_consent_forms_that/) where someone asked whether people should sign consent forms before having sex.

The general consensus of the replies was that, no, because the consent form would not prove that there was no rape: It does not prove that he did not *afterwards* do something to her which she did not consent to.

Well, understood, I guess. But that reply somehow still leaves me with a nagging question: Given that even that is not proof, how *would* anyone ever be able to prove that they obtained affirmative consent?

Consider the following hypothetical scenario: I have had sex with a woman. She enthusiastically consented. In fact, she screamed “f... me, oh, god yes, YES, f... me!” over and over again throughout the entire thing. Some time later she - for God knows what reason - accuses me of rape. If proving affirmative consent is the standard, just how am I supposed to prove the facts just described?

Filming the sex is the only thing that comes to mind. But to do that I either have to get her consent *to filming* (good luck with that), or I have to secretly film it which is not only practically difficult, but also comes with all sorts of other ethical issues.

It also comes with the problem that basically the same counterargument can be levelled as the one you used against the consent form: “Just because you have a video of her screaming “f... me!” at THIS particular point in time, doesn’t prove that you didn’t rape her, the second that video ends”.

But if even a video does not prove my innocence, then exactly what would? I can’t think of anything.

I also wonder, if there is any experience from jurisdictions where affirmative consent has been made the legal standard?: Has anyone accused ever been acquitted by proving they obtained affirmative consent? If so, what evidence did they present?


EDIT: 
Some of you seem to be answering on the basis of current law where affirmative consent is not YET the standard everywhere.

But my understanding is that that is what feminists are proposing to change?

I don’t claim to be an expert but my understanding is that the proposal (which is law in California and is proposed in Sweden) is that prosecutors only have to prove sex occurred.

38,Feminists feelings on Japanese Herbivore Men?,"Hi Reddit feminists.

The last couple years I've heard a little bit about Japanese herbivore men -- that being, as far as I understand it, a growing number of men that avoid relationships and sex with women, embodying traditional masculinity, consumerism, and are often vegetarians that are more in touch with their more feminine side by doing things like going shopping and eating fancy deserts with their fellow herbivores. Their appearance is often, but of course not always, quite feminine as well. You can google ""herbivore men.""

They're called herbivores because they don't approach women, much like how women are expected to act traditionally. Meaning that the old dynamic of men pursuing women as carnivores, and women playing defense as herbivores, has broken down and now resulted in a shrinking population and birth rate, and many women who want to get married but are unable to find a suitable husband.

Apparently from what I read, something like 50% of Japanese men in their 20's and 30's identify as herbivore, and the numbers are growing. Many Japanese women deride them as ""not men but boys"" and ""weak.""

The fears of population decline have gotten to the point where in Japan a ""television personality and economic analyst"" a few years ago proposed a tax on handsome men, to be redistributed to less-attractive men to encourage them to marry. I should mention the analyst is a Japanese man, and one I suspect wouldn't have to pay any extra tax lol. To determine who is handsome enough to pay the higher tax, juries of randomly-selected women would judge which men fit the bill.

Now I don't think that will ever become law, it seems absurd and hilarious to me, but it gives some indication how dire the problem of a shrinking population is in Japan. Problems such as the Japanese equivalent of social security collapsing are the government's primary fear here, as well as social cohesion. 

I'm an American man and it occurred to me that if American men adhered to feminist teachings that their masculinity is toxic, and thus shed their masculinity, you'd end up with a situation similar to the one in Japan with these herbivore men. So my question is, is this the desired result of feminism's derision of masculinity? I expect some women will say yes, these men are the ideal. Others might say no, that's a turn-off and I don't want to live in a culture of vegetarian men with feminine appearance, that go to all-male brunches and never approach women. Frankly that sounds a bit poo to me but maybe it sounds good to others. 

Anyway, curious on your thoughts. If you google ""herbivore men feminism"" there's basically no results. I was expecting a mix of ""yay girly men"" articles and ""they've gone too far"" articles. But nope, by all appearances no feminist has ever had an opinion on this, so I've come to ask you folks.

Thanks

Tldr; something like half of marriage-age Japanese men are opting out of marriage, masculinity, and basically living up to the expectations and pressures of society altogether.

43,What do you think about equal rights representative in Germany (explanation inside)?,"Because of the Equality Act (a genderneutral word in german) we have equal rights representatives in every City/Villagecouncil, every institution that gets grants from the government (e.g. Universities, Half-govermental research institutions etc.) and companies (part-time in companies over 100 employees and fulltime in every company over 600 employees). They have different goals (which I will discribe later) depending on the institution they work in and by law the office of the equal rights representative can only be held by a woman. The representives get hired by the cities/institutions and elected in companies. Only women can be elected and only women can vote.


Goals of equal rights representative in City-councils:

1. Equal vocational training, further training and advancement opportunities for men and women
2. Fairly paid jobs for men and women
3. A gender-equitable and effective representation in political committees, management and decision-making positions.
4. Better consideration of gender equality issues and gender-specific life situations in all legislative projects.
5. A fair distribution of work, household and parenting responsibilities between women and men.
6. Equal appreciation of male and female achievements in art, culture, history and sport.
7. The inviolability of dignity and the protection against physical and mental violence for men and women.

They do this by encouraging new laws, informing other city-councilmembers and helping with the planning of projects, working together with womengroups, and organising projects and events. 


Goals of equal rights representative in companies:

1. Equality for women and men
2. Compatibility of family and employment
3. Protection from sexual violence

How they do it according to wikipedia (and google translator, i feel a bit lazy today):

&gt;She is to be involved in personnel measures (eg recruitment), organizational and social matters at an early stage. In addition, she advises and supports women in their professional advancement or in cases of discrimination. She participates in the creation of the equality plan. She belongs to the personnel administration, but is free from instructions in the exercise of its activity. The assignment is amongst other things important for the file inspection right, which also extends to personnel files and refers to the parts relevant to the decision. In these cases, it does not require the consent of those affected.



Goals of equal rights representative in Institutions (in this example: my local university):

1. representing all female members and members of the [local University]: female students, technical and administrative staff, scientific staff and professors.
2. Initiation and organisation of programs, projects and facilities that help to achieve equality
3. Equal representation of women and men in places of power.

They do this by initiating projects, informing the university-council and monitoring recruitment procedures.



I have the following problems with this form of equal rights representative:

1. It violates the constitution. Article 3 paragraph 1:
(1) All persons shall be equal before the law.
Obiously men and women arent when only women can have an important office for both men and women and only women can vote on who has this office. I see this as a (systemic) discrimination against men that hurts equality.


2. It robs men of the opportunity to represent themselves and their gender-specific problems. Many of the goals of the equal rights representative also effect men. Things like Compatibility of family and employment are very important to men too, especially right now, when many men fight against the genderrole that men should be the provider and men taking paternaty-leave or decide to be a stay-at-home-dad are still shamed for their decicion. Another point thats very important for mens rights is this: ""The inviolability of dignity and the protection against physical and mental violence for men and women."" In my city there still isnt even one shelter or institution for men who suffer from domestic or sexual violence. Its a thing many people (some equal rights representative including) have criticised, but there isnt any developement. There even was a case where a equal rights representative was fired by local politicians for apparently caring too much about mens issues (like initiating a group for men who are going to be fathers or men who experience violence).

3. Most equal rights representative nearly exclusivly do something about womens issues. While this isnt a problem when a feminist group does it, when a official govermental office thats paid with tax money and has the goal to help achieve equality uses their (taxpaid) budget (that should help men and women) and only spends it on womens issues it is an issue because it actively harms men by taking their funds away from them. I can give examples if necessary.

4. There are equal rights representative who seem to have a sexist view on men/hold up genderroles and stereotypes.

All of these problems could have easely been avoided by having 2 equal rights representative (one of each gender) working together (which would be my prefered solution) or by opening the office for men too.

46,dealing with cognitive bias,"Ok so, before i get into any details let me state the main question so i can stay on track. after noticing a negative thought pattern,(eg sexism, racism, homophobia) what should one do to correct this behavior?

Not sure really where to start this but i generally feel as though i dont let myself be guided by stereotypes but its hard to gauge for certain and take a truly objective look at your own past actions. im not even really sure this is the best place to ask this but id rather have someone else opinion and advice on the matter. 

Quite frankly in my usual cycle of; almost acceptance, self hatred, and unsuccessful repression, i have told myself some hateful things that really made me question how accepting i actually am of others as well as some of the possible reasons behind such a thought process. 

Starting with feminism itself, the first feminist i met was of the ""kill all born with a Y chromosome"" variety. now i have sense then come to realize that her being crazy and feminism have nothing to do with each other, but by this point her words, along with the ""crazy sjw"" stereotype portrayed by certain media have left a impression in me that is at odds with my own political views and ideals. 

Moving right along to racism, i live in an area that one might call ""predominantly white"". i can actually count on one hand how many people i have met who are not white, none of them are exactly pleasant to be around. Lately however i have to wonder if its just bad luck on the few i met, or if there is more of a selective bias going on here. 

On being sexist, i grew up in a rather traditional middle class family, mom cooked and cleaned and dad did all the grunt work. it always seemed like a mixed bag here as they seemed fine with *others* choosing less traditional lifestyles but at the same time had very strict ideas of what a man or a women ""should do"". i thought that i hadnt been affected by this until i started noticing myself thinking things such as [""typical woman, cant park for shit"", &amp; ""thats not how a *real man* acts"".](/spoiler)

Would i even be considered homophobic. i was taught from a young age that ""there is a deference between a man who happens to be gay and a [faggot](/spoiler)"", and while there are multiple problems with that statement, to this day i find it hard to be around ""stereotypical"" gay or flamboyant men.

53,Any advice on dealing with female collaborators to male violence?,"So Elizabeth and Philip (not real names) are a couple. They are both politically quite progressive, poly, kinky, queer, feminist and very open about their life. Elizabeth helps run a big social club dedicated to queer, poly, kinky and other sex related things.
Elizabeth and a few other women are the ones who have complete control over this club. 

This club is a big deal to a lot of people. It’s been running for many years and has hundreds of members who feel a sense of community with one another.

The problem is that Elizabeth’s long term primary partner (and dom) Philip is a rapist.

I know of at least 20 women who have told me that Phillip has sexually harassed, sexual assaulted, sexually coerced or penetrated them without their consent. 

He’s one of those abusive BDSM blokes who thinks that sexual abuse is just his way of being kinky. 

He’s one of those guys who thinks of sexual consent in terms of “what can I get away with doing to her”.

I don’t think any of the victims want to go to the police about it. 

It’s not the sort of thing that can be easily prosecuted and most of the women just choose to block him and quietly warn others about him. 

There’s not much I think I can do with Philip. He already knows about some of these allegations; a few women have confronted him before. Sometimes he gives some BS line about having learned from his “past mistakes” but he doesn’t change his behaviour.

Very occasionally one of these women will feel comfortable coming forward to one of the other women who run this club with an allegation against him.

Elizabeth protects Philip from these allegations. She loves him and won’t hear a word against him (also bear in mind that she is his 24-7 slave and has basically given him consent to do anything to her. I don’t think she is one of his victims)

She has told the other administrators of this club that women have lied about Philip in the past and that women who come forward with these allegations should be treated with scepticism.

I’m not sure if the other women who help run the club buy this line. However Elizabeth is the one with the most power, she has been their the longest and most of the time they just roll with whatever she says. 

As far as I’m concerned this makes Elizabeth, and to a certain extent all the other women who run the club, collaborators to male violence.

IMHO Philip is the one responsible for his actions. But Elizabeth is the one to blame for proving him with a pool of fresh victims.

I think I can confront the other women who run the club about this. I’m not sure if I could get them to ban Philip without more allegations against him. But I might be able to convince them that 
Elizabeth’s occupation of a leadership role prevents women from coming forward with allegations against Philip and that they should fire her for that reason.

54,How would you feel if you discovered a friend made fake porn of you but didn't distribute it?,"With the creation of DeepFakes, we can now see anyone with a computer and a couple hundred pictures of someone splice their image into porn, looking very close to being real. Ignoring whether it is legal or not, I am wondering how you feel about the ethics of personal use.

Say you have a friend making fakes of you or someone else, but not distributing them. They just use them for themselves and don't share at all. Do you feel complimented? Violated? Both? Do you feel that the image of your face is deeply personal, or is it something something separate from you?

Moreover, where do you draw the distinction? If someone splices your face into a video which they clearly identify as fake, as a joke, is this a violation? Not even porn just splicing you into a potentially embarrassing movie clip or something.

I look forward to your responses.

55,Feminism modeled as a religion?,"I grew up in the southern United States and was raised and surrounded by Baptists. I have since abandoned religion, and more broadly, any kind of ideology. In high school, my family relocated to New England, where I was exposed to a brand new social atmosphere, and befriended many self-identified feminists (I had never heard the word before relocating).

I’ve noticed some stark similarities in the way that feminists and Christians view their system of beliefs, often by how they write about and defend them on social media. For example, many feminists and Christians alike will allude to the fact that they are a feminist/Christian in their “bio” on social media platforms. They will share articles defending their beliefs with the attitude that feminism/Christianity is the basis for every “right” idea, and will appeal to their ideological dogma when their beliefs are questioned. And when a follower of either ideology has a “bad” idea, they are branded as “not a real feminist/Christian.” They also tend to have a negative disposition towards those who do not identify as feminist/Christian.

Obviously, all of these observations are qualitative, and they certainly do not apply to all feminists/Christians - just the more vocal ones. To summarize: the way that feminists view their beliefs reminds me of the way that Christians view theirs. This could probably apply to the vocal members of any two ideologies, but this comparison has been more prominent to be based on where I have lived and what I have been exposed to.

My question is this: Have you ever observed or “felt” any parallels between feminism and religion? 

When asked this question, feminists have generally responded with “no,” while non-feminists have generally responded with “yes.”

59,"How do you prove rape? How do we increase the number of convictions, without lowering the standard of evidence?","I have heard feminists often complain about the low rate of convictions compared to the number of rapes. I fundementally agree with this and think it is a real problem. However, I do not see how we can fix it and I do not think the proposed methods would. I am wondering how you think they will? For example, one issue I see brought up a lot is rape kits. We have a massive backup of them not getting processed. However, almost never can a rape kit actually prove rape. All a rape kit can prove (in the vast majority of cases) is that sex occurred. And sex occurring, is not enough evidence to prove rape occurred (as the law stands).

Basically, I would like to know two things.

1. What changes do you think we can make to better prosecute rapists (while maintaining our standards of evidence)?

2. How will these changes better let us prove rape occurred?

65,what is wrong again with boss/employee relationships?,"This is cross-posted from /r/askwomenadvice:

tl;dr - what is wrong with having sex with one's boss?

--

Hi everyone,

This is going to seem pretty basic but I am not an expert, I want you to tell me what I'm missing.

So, I'm a team lead, pretty reserved at work.  one of my reports has showed pretty strong interest over the past few months (including breathless calls late at night), as far as flirtatious behavior I would say not beyond what could be acceptable but showed her interest.  She asks repeatedly about my private life and also says she has a boyfriend and what if, hypothetically, she left her boyfriend to be with me, I forget the sentence context but that hypothetical really shocked me.  (For one thing, because women in that situation really tend to have an affair instead, not leave their boyfriend - I thought it was cute that she was thinking in those terms.)

When I was not a lead I dated coworkers there is no issue around this.  However before recently I would have thought in a reporting relationship it is absolutely off-limits.  (we haven't done anything wrong or unprofessional or met outside of work.)

***CONS*** (that I can think of):  As she is a direct report I think this is a very bad idea.  For one thing, it would compromise her authority in the team.  (Not really possible to keep a secret I guess?)  There is no coercive part here (I'm not coercing her) but I still think that it's ""automatically"" wrong/coercive because of power.  What I mean is if she waited until a few weeks after one of us had left the company (we're not going to be here for the next 20 years) I would think it's different.  She has this interest because we work closely, see each other daily, and, don't you think it's *automatically* due to my having power (even if she denies this)?  Basically my view is that she can't even consent, due to being my direct report, just like if she was underage or something.

***PROS*** (that I can think of): However I can see the following arguments on the other side (for why it should be OK): 1) most importantly, there is a team-building aspect.  It is good to have a close relationship with people, so socializing outside of work might have this effect.  Here almost nothing is as intimate as two people having sex, so, what is the benefit exactly to keeping such strict limits if it's consensual? Can't this be team-building.  2) The company policy does not prohibit this. (It prohibits coertion or ""quid-pro-quo"".)  We're just people.  The company shouldn't butt into what we do on our own time.  3) it could help retention.  you are less likely to leave a place that has your SO.

Anyway I tried to do some Internet research but I'm really torn.  I saw a link to a survey that asked if having sex with a boss is wrong in all cases and a sizeable percentage said ""no"".  I would have thought 100% this is TOTALLY inherently wrong on its face.  There is a position of power there and that makes it automatically wrong.

I am starting to have doubts and would like to have more reasons from you all for why it is wrong.",AskFeminists,1517108714,whysobad2,15,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7thpo4/what_is_wrong_again_with_bossemployee/,2018-01-27

69,Was Siri's voice a product of misogyny?,"Edit: The consensus for the moment at least is that:

- people perceive Siri as a servant not a service.
- people don't care that it is more knowledgeable than they are, only its base function
- people don't see the relationship they subconsciously build with devices, at least not with this type of device.

This has been really helpful so far, thanks for contributing and I hope others will also offer their opinions.

---
I'll say off the bat, I don't think it was which is why I'm asking the question. Hopefully, if it was at the end of this I'll understand why and better be able to incorporate social considerations into technology in the future. Thanks in advance.

Fore note: The Wired article was written after the male voice option was added.

When Siri was realised it faced criticism from feminists under the pretense that the decision to make its voice female was sexist / misogynistic. 

The research into the voice selection is pretty thorough and concludes that both men and women would prefer a female voice for disembodied virtual actors that have the same purpose as Siri. It goes into a bit further detail explaining that women had a stronger preference and therefore their preference was given more weigh than those of them involved in the studies. Having read this, I couldn't see how it could be seen as sexist.

However, recent discussion, in contrast to the initial outrage now suggested that the problem was that Siri is merely an assistant and therefore assigning it a female voice was stereotyping and demeaning.

There are two questions this raised for me which is currently holding me to my original stance:

- Do people really see Siri as a bottom-tier assistant?

There's two things here 1) as I see it, Siri is an oracle, an entity with unquestionable knowledge, capable of things that are beyond the skills of any person. 2) Siri is a disembodied virtual actor, not a person. People subconsciously assign human traits and stereotypes to electric devices despite being fully aware it does not warrant humane treatment. Does being a female voice implicitly mean it is being demeaned or is there more to it?

- There were two only two possible outcomes. Could it have been handled better?

People didn't like synthesized voices to the point where Siri wouldn't have been nearly as well received as it was. Given the female voice was the universal preference, I don't see how choosing male could've been better or that the outrage could've been predicted.",AskFeminists,1517158670,Count___Duckula,48,4,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7tldiy/was_siris_voice_a_product_of_misogyny/,2018-01-28

Some women expressed though how they don’t want a man that displays himself like that for every girl to see.

Maybe it’s the dating app difference because with my brief time I’ve spent on tinder women don’t tend to put up “promiscious” photos on their dating profile. So yeah just curious about opinions.

72,Why can't circumcision be equated with FGM (and be called MGM)?,"So i have heared some people on this sub say that circumcision shouldn't be called Male genital mutilation) because FGM is way worse than Circumcision.

So I searched for a definition and found this classification used by the WHO for FGM:

&gt;Type I — Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce (clitoridectomy). When it is important to distinguish between the major variations of Type I mutilation, the following subdivisions are proposed:
Type Ia, removal of the clitoral hood or prepuce only;
Type Ib, removal of the clitoris with the prepuce.

&gt;Type II — Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (excision). When it is important to distinguish between the major variations that have been documented, the following subdivisions are proposed:
Type IIa, removal of the labia minora only;
Type IIb, partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora;
Type IIc, partial or total removal of the clitoris, the labia minora and the labia majora.

&gt;Type III — Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation). When it is important to distinguish between variations in infibulations, the following subdivisions are proposed:
Type IIIa, removal and apposition of the labia minora;
Type IIIb, removal and apposition of the labia majora.

&gt;Type IV — All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.

I'm my opinion Type 1a and Type 4 are either completely comparable or more ""harmless"" than Circumcision. So why not call circumcision what it is, male genital mutilation?

73,At what point are compliments from strangers harassment? When would you call them objectifying?,"First of all, I would say I would never make a comment to a stranger on the street. It just seems odd to me. However, I have gotten comments from strangers, and never thought of them as harassment (besides one time someone started following me around). 

I am curious where you would draw the line. In my view, if it is going to be some standard we uphold there has to be an objective line for what is harassment and what is just compliments, not made at the best time. 

As for the second part, I have heard some comments (street harassment one might call it) called objectifying. I am curious why this is, and in comparison to other comments. For example, I have quite often seen women walk up to other women they do not know and say something like ""I like your top"" before walking away. I have never heard that termed harassment or called objectifying. However, if a man walked up to that same woman and said ""you've got nice breasts"" before walking away, I suspect some would consider that objectifying and harassment.

77,What's your take on veganism? How can we make feminism more involving of all groups?,"The type of feminism (ive started to be exposed to other types) that i agree with is about tearing down hierarchies of power that result in negative consequences for everyone.

Eating an animal is unnecessary as their are competely viable alternatives and only serves as a manifestation of the power that true feminism is dismantling. The mother-baby relationship is directly exploited for personal gain (not even a needed person gain, just a greedy one) at the cost of animal suffering. In order to get milk from a female cow, she is forcefully artificially inseminated by a piece of equipment used to restrain them.

The entire basis of dairy farming is forcing a woman to get pregnant, then stealing their baby and destroying its opportunity to be a mother, like it naturally should just to create a product with suitable alternatives. Feminism should not BE only about elevating the status of oppressed people but it is also about fighting for the rights of oppressed groups - including animals.

Although ive gotten used to it by now, i feel very offended when someone claims to be a feminist but supports this system that oppresses a group nobody seems to care about. The only thing separating them from us is what they were born as, and somehow that gives us the justification to literally torture them for personal gain. To claim to be an avocate of supporting all oppressed groups and an intersectional feminist whilst supporting this system is the hight of hypocrisy but just like with the patriarchy nobody seems to listen or care. They just make meaningless excuses as to why its not true like 'we are different, we evolved to be like this'.

79,How do I navigate gender roles in hetero relationships?,"I'm a transgender woman.  Whilst I was in denial, I identified as a ""straight man"".  My relationships and sexual attraction were exclusively with women.

Ultimately, I came to terms with my own identity and stopped living in denial.  I have now transitioned, and I'm finally living as myself.  One thing that I was not expecting during this process though, was a sexuality flip.  Ultimately, I have lost sexual attraction to women, and find myself attracted to men.

My problem is, I didn't want this, and I'm not ready for it, especially in terms of relationships.  I find myself actively repelled by the typical gender roles in most hetero relationships that I am familiar with.  If anyone describes themselves as a ""gentleman"" or says they ""know how to treat a lady"" or wants to pay for dinner or pull my chair out etc, I find myself actively uncomfortable and disturbed.  I don't want anything to do with possessive masculinity, or anything that treats femininity as a mystery or as precious and delicate.  I'm also in my early 40s, so finding men who don't default to some sort of traditional masculinity role is very hard.

Now, I can't be the only feminist that has grappled with attraction to men, but I have struggled to find anything out there to help me navigate this problem.

So when we take these two premises and put them together there can't be (institutionalized) oppression based on sexism against men in a patriarchy. Feminists say that the US for example is a patriarchy. 

Now there are some problems men face, like the prison gap, the education gap and the draft which all have a systemic root and the discrimination is inherent to these institutions. In a non-patriarchal society you could call them institutionalised sexism.

Now there can't be institutionalised sexism against the class in power (men) in a patriarchy. My question is: What is it then? Does it have a name?

84,"Communication, a variable in the prevalence of feminist/mgtow ideals?","I will be thrilled to read all your responses to a few of the questions I find myself asking when I peruse subreddits such as r/feminists and r/mgtow and forums akin to those two.

Here are the questions: When perceived cues -verbal and body language- that occur during communication between women and men are interpreted as offensive, do these offensive cues transmit a variable of perceived sexism in a conversation that is otherwise void of any conscientious sexist speech.

Which do you consider the more prominent variable in perceived offenses communicated between the sexes: The message communicated or the manner in which the message is communicated?

Could you consider a hypothesis that suggests the American contemporary atmosphere of these types of ideals -feminism, mgtow, mra, etc.- be rooted in misinterpretation during communication more so than the observance of a conscious practice of sexism?

85,Discussion (and x-post),"Disclaimer: I consider myself a feminist. As per the sidebar I want to clarify that I'm hoping for fruitful discussion, not to ""gotcha"" feminism.

I was browsing around, not looking at any stories in particular, when I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSFeminism/comments/5nfsx9/my_friends_article_about_her_recent_experience/). Now, I wanna be super-duper clear: I select this story for a talking point because it fits very neatly into what I wanna talk about. I did not select it to bully the author, nor to defame her. She's not on trial here, the system is. In case it isn't clear: in no way, shape, or form am I entertaining thoughts of false accusation by that woman. Like most accusers, I assume her claim is genuine.

But she's sad, if you read her article, that ""the system failed her."" As she put it. I mean, her rapist is free, so like...the system didn't win, but it looks to me like the system was working quite elegantly. The policeman knew that the pursuit would not lead to a conviction and thus ended it. There was no evidence. She didn't receive a rape kit, which would only prove sex was had (although since he didn't corroborate that they had sex, things could get hairy, he could spin it on her that ""we raped each other."") and not that force was used (depending on the severity of his force, it's not impossible the rape kit would corroborate her statement that he forced himself on her uninviting, dry vagina - which would hurt him immensely) but we have this problem.

I'll explain the problem after this disclaimer: I remind the reader that I am not picking on this author. I am sure she's a victim, no question, but I'm not 100% certain, which brings me to the problem.

Burden of proof. We enjoy, in our judicial courts, a reasonable-doubt burden of proof. This means that every juror must be certain that the accuser is correct to accuse the accused. They have to be certain that the action took place and that the minds were in the place necessary for it to be criminal. That means a rape victim must prove (not just show evidence for but reasonably prove) multiple things: 1: sex took place. This isn't that hard if you accuse right away, with rape kits and such, but it's not easy. Ideally, this would be the hardest part. Ideally. 2: the sex was not consensual. #2 is kind of a bitch.

Regarding #2...if consent is withdrawn and the rapist has evidence that the victim at some point consented, the victim is pretty much fucked. That's why I call ""consent forms"" ""rape permission slips"" because realistically, you're almost waiving rights. You're not, but you are not protected by them.

If a victim's rapist is a lover or spouse, she's fucked. Realistically, now. Unless she somehow has some preposterously ground-breaking evidence like a camera in the bedroom placed specifically to catch him raping her which...wow.

If it's reasonable to conclude that one's actions may lead to sex (going out for drinks w/ a friend as friends) and they end up having sex without drugs in their veins, consensual or otherwise, how does the victim prove non-consent without evidence of violence? How does the victim prove they're not self-inflicted?

So. I ask the feminists of Reddit, what can we do? We've clearly got a problem here where rapists are in fact getting away with shit, and we can't exactly shift the burden of proof because if we do that, we will have innocent people in jail. Unless someone does feel that's worth it then...yeah, I'd love to hear that. I really wanna have a sincere dialogue about this. I have tried very hard to deal only in facts in this post so please, don't like...think im defending anything.

And for clarification: no, I don't think that, ""This whole anti-rape thing is gonna land me in jail."" I'm not a rapist so I know that I'm fine.

88,Overcoming problems with accepting feminism!,"Hello people!

I'm an European guy who very much likes the idea of equal benefits and equal obligations but there a number of experiences/facts that just bring up a wall in my head whenever I hear someone say they are a feminist and here are just SOME of them:

1. In my country women can retire at 63 and men at 65.

2. Military or Police Academies have different physical requirements for men and women (i.e. women have to perform less to get accepted).

3. There are A LOT of self-identified feminists that show clear signs of sexims (e.g. ganging up on men in the office for retaliating against a woman who insulted him, stating that a man should only fight a woman if his life is in danger and only restrain her otherwise - so you NEED to have the mental awareness when punched by a women to determine if her attacks can be lethal).

4. Companies no longer give EQUAL OPPORTUNITY when hiring but clearly state that they are looking for women.

5. Women complaining about the men-to-women ratio in leadership positions when I work for one of the largest IT companies in the world and from what I see here the majority of leadership roles are held by women.

6. Feminists (and a good friend at that) that told me to my face that ""your opinion on how feminists should approach the movement is null because you are a man"" (I told her that although it is not the main point of concern for the movement, maybe feminists should focus a bit more on silencing the ""kill all men"" extremists because they give feminism a really bad name and if someone uneducated in terms of feminism has their first contact with the movement through someone like that...well...you have a pretty high chance of turning them away from it for good).

7. How complicated everything has gotten in terms of men-women interactions because of the movement. What I mean is that we live in a mixed society and by that I mean traditional and equal-rights-between-sexes people and for someone who believes in the equal rigts/obligations it gets really damn tiresome to switch from one to another in order to not create friction when interacting with one type or the other. (e.g. some women expect you to carry heavy stuff for them and other find it sexist).

As I mentioned, these are just some which came to mind that gets me angry and just makes me want to stop interacting with women. I feel that I'm getting a ""just do whatever the hell you want but stay out of my way"" attitude or even worse.

I also feel like we got to such a ridiculous level of political correctness that I am afraid to make ANY contribution to conversations cause who knows...I might make a joke about 3 handed people and I might offend a guy who has a 3-rd hand and works on the 8th level and someone else knows him.

So how do I overcome all this stuff ? I can't just stay focused on the ideas behing the movement because I just can't have my brain overcome every stupid thing like the ones mentioned above.

I apologize as I realize that this came of more as a rant than a question but it is something that bothers me and I want to do the right thing and be fair.

95,Is privilege universal?,"I realise that this might not be an absolutely relevant board for this question, but it is related to feminism and activism in general. 

Do you see a lot of feminist discourse as being particularly 'Anglo-centric'? What I mean is this, I hear a lot about ""white privilege"" for instance. I'm sure I just missed the memo or the subtext, but this is certainly only relevant in *certain* circumstances. For instance, being a white man in rural Bangladesh or Afghanistan is not going to get you any privileges (and indeed, a higher risk of personal violence). 

The same goes for the purported universality of ['male privilege'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minangkabau_people). Now, I conceed that there has never been a society exclusively dominated by women, but there have been many societies throughout history that have not had an ostensible 'patriarchy' in the fashion oft-espoused in feminist literature. 

Note: I am not disputing the existence of privilege (that's time for another debate). 

I was more just curious if any feminists believe that these are objective an universal. That is, white privilege is something universal and pervasive.

103,Post-equality feminism abuse?,"Hello!

Although this is a hypothetical question, I am curious if anyone else thinks about this (from the feminists ranks).

There are already people out there who use the feminism movement to either market their products/person and in general for personal gains and other reasons that are not part of the movement's objectives (e.g. companies using feminism as an product placing ad, celebrities using feminism to be trendy, false rape accusations etc.).

Do you think it is likely that after we get to the point of true equality **for women** that people (in considerable numbers) will use the inertia of feminism to gain unfair advantages and that they will basically tip the balance of equality on the other side?

Considering what I see around me, I think it is a real possibility. Some men are starting to be paranoid about interactions with women, about what they say, how and where they look and are getting so apologetic for anything. 

I can see how some people (and yes...I mean mostly women) would be able to abuse the pre-equality history in order to gain unfair advantages in the world.

147,"No, seriously, is the main difference between TRP and feminism really that “OUR bogey man is REAL”? If not, what is an example of something feminism considers women’s own ‘fault’?","Recently there was a thread  on why men turn to TRP.

The most upvoted reply gave the explanation that

&gt;It offers simple solutions to complex problems, externalizes blame for one’s perceived shortcomings, and rationalizes bad behavior for the sake of convenience. These are all very easy selling points for desperate, or just intellectually/morally lazy, people...

I responded that I don’t necessarily disagree, but the same can be said of feminism. It offers women the easy way out, that instead of self-improving, it is all the fault of men and the patriarchy. 

I gave examples such as the wage gap and promotions (it’s not that you didn’t put in the effort to get a relevant degree and work long hours, it’s the patriarchy) and “body positivity” (it’s not that you eat too much and don’t work out enough, it’s the patriarchy).

I admit that I was, I guess, trolling a bit; the examples were worded with a slight bit of hyperbole and some of my responses were slightly more simplistic than my actual views. But *very* far from being *as* hyperbolic or unfair as feminists’ constant absurd strawmanning of their opponents. I chose this approach because, in a discussion on whether feminism is comparable to TRP, I wanted to see how you would react to - a much milder version of - what the other side gets.

And predictably you all reacted by down voting to oblivion and essentially screaming how I must be a moron and an awful person because I don’t see, that women REALLY, TRULY, REALLY do NOT have responsibilty for their own choices, and that it REALLY, TRULY, REALLY *IS* the fault of men and patriarchy.

What I find so fascinating about this reaction is that probably MGTOWs, for example, would react in largely the same way: “STFU, men suffer and it really, truly, really IS all the fault of women and gynocentrism. What an idiot you must be that you don’t understand; what an awful person you are that you don’t care!”.

So the difference between TRP and feminism does NOT seem to be that feminism does NOT externalize blame.

The difference is - apparently - that feminism RIGHTLY externalizes blame to men and the patriarchy, whereas TRP *WRONGLY* externalizes blame to women and gynocentrism.

The difference is NOT that feminism does NOT have a “bogey man”. The difference is - apparently - only that “OUR bogey man is REAL. Theirs is not”.

Well, that is of course a possibility: Two largely identical ideologies, in that they mirror each other: One assigning to men or Patriarchy the blame for evil befalling women and the other assigning to women or gynocentrism blame for evil befalling men. Yet one is 100% right and the other dead wrong. I am pretty sure eg MGTOWs think that, too, only they think THEY are right.

But I am not particularly interested in a discussion on whether one of these mirroring views is correct. It just ends up in you again screaming essentially “But OUR bogey man IS real, can’t you see it!” a billion times.

I am more interested in WHY you don’t seem to have anything except “But OUR bogey man IS real!”? Regardless of how religiously convinced you are that this is so, it still means that we have perfect symmetry: The redpillers, too, scream exactly the same, equally religiously convinced, that THEIR bogey man IS real.

One feminist responded that my characterisation “ain’t feminism”.

No? I responded by asking a question the answer to which *might* have proven me wrong but which - of course - received no reply, so I re-ask it here:

Name ONE example of something which feminists think is i) bad for women but which feminists ALSO consider is ii) basically women’s own responsibility. 

And I don’t mean some roundabout nonsense where it is still really men’s fault like “women do have a responsibility to speak out against their oppression by men”.

I mean just ONE bad which is, well, women’s own ‘fault’, if you will? 

ONE example where feminists almost unanimously say to women “oh, come on, you cry-baby, you cannot seriously blame men for THAT. You made your own bed. It was your own responsibility getting into that mess and it’s your own responsibility to get out of it.”

I can’t think of any.

If there are no examples, then again, how is feminism different from TRP, *except* for “But OUR bogey man IS real” (which, as I pointed out, is not even a difference)?

156,I do not understand,"Hello! I have an honest question that will hopefully receive an honest answer. I am completely confused. About ten years ago I considered myself to be a idealist and feminist. I was young and attending college: I wanted to be given the same opportunity as men. I experienced many traumas, and I was active in speaking out against them and educating other young women. I was strong, ambitious, darn near fearless, and determined. But I was unhappy.

***I am not implying that feminists aren't happy. I can only speak for myself.***  As I have grown older, I have changed- I don't know that young woman I used to be. I find that I am happy with the life I have chosen, even though it is quite a traditional one. No one is more surprised than me. My husband never said that he expects me to assume that role, I volunteered for it. 

Here is my confusion.  What do I do? I have quite a few feminist friends who are campaigning against the very thing that I enjoy. I am not talking about the right to choose: they want it eradicated forever. I understand why: my chosen path is not something that would make them happy. I want them to be happy. But I also want them to understand that I have not been brainwashed or programmed or coerced. I would like us to be sisters who just happen to have different types of relationships.  I would like us to fight for our common beliefs about our rights, and leave our differences behind.

170,Do you think most women even want equality?,"In Finland we have a mandatory military service for men, with a median length of 9 months. Every year over 20 thousand men go through it while the number of women who volunteer to do the same is around 400. You have some asshole scream at you from 6 a.m all the way to the evening while you are doing uncomfortable physical labor in constant hurry, then you have a couple of hours of free time to spend with people who don't like you because they suspect you might like to suck a dick and then you go to sleep in the same room with eleven other guys who smell of sweat and cannot shut up no matter how sleep deprived everyone is. The camping periods suck even more. 

Considering how much talking one hears about equality one might think that women would either sign up for the military service or stop voting for parties that support it being mandatory for men. But no, I haven't met a single one who gives a shit, except for the half a dozen that I have heard loudly saying that they would never date a guy who hadn't been to the army because ""They are not real men.""

It really seems that this is a huge sticking point because If you could prove that somehow it isn't zero sum but If fact you are increasing the size of the game for ev eryone,  then mucg more people would be on board.

Personally I think it's just a line that feminists and other social justice groups use in order to pretend that their power grab is beneficial for everyone.

12,What are the key differences between feminisms?,"I ask because, as an MRA and critic of feminism, I often get accused of falsely painting feminists as a monolith, so I'm thinking of targeting my criticism more at a particular subgroup(s). Also because [in a recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7osf8i/what_question_do_you_wish_antifeminists_would_ask/), many of you said you want more open-minded non-gotcha questions. 

I have read plenty on the major divisions among feminists from roughly mid-1960s up to mid-1990s (eg. socialist vs radical, radical vs cultural, sex-positive vs sex-negative, etc). But today, feminists rarely qualify their feminism with adjectives, and often come across as presenting an aggressive united front against a wide variety of critics including MRAs (we critics are also often presented as monolithic, but I digress).

So I am wondering, what are the major debates within feminism today? What are the major camps called and what key points do they disagree on? Are the old divisions from the second wave still raging, or largely resolved? How relevant today are traditional adjectives like liberal, socialist, radical, etc? Conversely, what points would you say all/most feminists agree on?

When I do hear an adjective, it is usually ""intersectional"" or ""radical"". What are the key differences there? Am I right in thinking the intersectionals have power in media and academia whereas the radicals have power in law, policymaking, and services?

13,Female Fighter Pilots,"It's no secret that there are some amazing female pilots.  A few years ago I worked with someone who was opposed to females being pilots.  Not because he didn't think they were as good as a male pilot, but because he felt like it was financially irresponsible to have female pilots.  His basis was this:

It costs up to $9 million to train a single pilot (multiple sources give different, some say $6 million a year for fighter pilots while cargo jets cost less in training).  Pilots need to fly XX amount of hours each month/year in order to keep their qualifications.  Once a woman gets pregnant she can no longer fly because this almost guarantees a miscarriage.  This causes them to get decertified and after the baby is born the pilot then needs to go back through training to get re-qualified. Some of these women opt to retrain completely and no longer be a pilot after becoming a mom, while some separate completely.  This costs multiple issues for squadrons.

A unit is only authorized so many pilots.  When a pilot can't fly, the other pilots need to fill in for that pilot without getting additional manning.  However, flight crews have rest requirements to prevent over-flying crews that aren't mentally rested.  This means that crews need to fly more frequently, possibly forcing them to bust crew-rest and endangering the aircraft, crew, cargo, and passengers on board.

There were more arguments he provided but I usually tuned him out the best I could when he would go on his rants. 

If you're a liberal feminist how do you justify female pilots when you also want the DoD to shrink their budget? 10 female pilots that choose to retrain/separate costs an unnecessary 100+ million dollars.  I understand this is a very minor bump to the 500+ billion dollar DoD budget,  but 100 million dollars is still a lot of money.

For the record, I support woman pilots and think the added cost in training hindrances are worth the cost.

20,"How do you, as a feminist, think we can achieve a constructive discussion between feminists and non-feminists?","While speaking with feminists and non-feminists about gender equality I noticed 2 things:

1. Many feminists had bad experiences while interacting with non-feminists. Thinks like being called man-haters and people who automatically think the worst of them or having their experiences of sexism dismissed (talking about you ""not all man"").

Many non-feminists (me included) have had bad experience while interacting with feminists. Things like being called mysoginists or being grouped with redpillers while simply stating that they don't believe in some feminist theory or having their experiences of sexism dismissed (""You can't be sexist against men"").


Sounds similar? Well most people are trying to be good and are in favour of equality (imo), but not everyone's definition of equality is the same.

But that's not happening and here comes observation 2:

2. Groups tend to circlejerk their own opinions without getting in contact with contrasting opinions. This happens especially after bad encounters with people of other opinions. Confirmation Bias kicks in and before you notice you have built your opinion and refuse to even consider to change it.

25,The 2003 Battlestar Galactica - does it depict a world with gender equality (or something close to it)?,"The recent remake of Battlestar Galactica might stand as my favourite TV series ever, but I've never heard much for feminist opinions of it, which is kind of remarkable since it was such a big deal that they made many of the original male characters female. Interestingly, those characters were accepted by fans pretty quickly, unlike what happened with the new Ghostbusters.

I'm wondering how those of you who saw it felt about the world it presented. It certainly looked like it was trying to depict a world in which women were equal; assertive women were never dismissed as ""bossy"", women worked alongside men in virtually every capacity, probably every episode passes the Bechdel test with flying colours, and the characters were never reduced to their sexual value.

That said, I could see someone saying that some of the traits we now call toxic masculinity were just sort of imprinted onto many of the female characters (Kara Thrace especially), though I don't think this was true across the board.

What do you think? Did Battlestar Galactica depict a world in which gender equality had been largely achieved? Or was it more problematic than that?

This is specifically in the context of how often feminists portray those opposed to them as virgins, or otherwise sexually unsuccessful. By doing so, the Red Piller acknowledge this, they are tacitly admitting that the sexual success of men have a direct connection to their value.

It makes seem that feminists don't particularly care about unsuccessful men and would seem them as lesser.

40,What do you think of this article on Damore?,"This is the sort of piece that I think turns off a lot of people off feminism and other 'social justice' issues that tend to share the same advocates/philosophies. 

I identify as a feminist (in a 'believe equality is good and doesn't exist' way rather than deep engagement with underlying theory) but find this sort of thing quite worrying and feel it's hard to defend the good arguments because they get associated with it. 

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/11/discriminate-conservatives-james-damore-suing-google-intolerance#comments

For those who don't see my issue with it, lots are raised below the line, but essentially there are two main elements that increasingly worry me here

First, not taking truthfulness seriously. The opening para lies twice. Totally clear-cut, it claims the memo says Google shouldn't pursue diversity, when it says the opposite and suggests ways to do so. It also claims the memo says ""men are better at computers"" which to be immensely charitable you could argue is a translation of 'men on average across the population are more interested in things that associate with doing well in computing as it currently exists', but is grossly misleading. These are compounded by not linking to the memo itself.

Second, although this is by no means the worst case I've seen on the Guardian, the general recourse to name-calling and abuse. This links to the lack of concern for truth, but also I think feeds into a problem in various places in current (maybe always?) politics where those who disagree with you must be scum/vermin who don't deserve to be allowed to express their views.

It may be that there's some deep analysis that shows why Damore is completely wrong. But if so, it definitely isn't provided, and so the effect of this will be adding to the drip feed of people thinking 'oh, is this what social justice / feminism is? Not for me then'.",AskFeminists,1515697325,CuriousastheCat,17,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7pqdoa/what_do_you_think_of_this_article_on_damore/,2018-01-11

49,What should I have done in this situation?,"Shortly before i start: In the last few days I asked many questions about different topics and most of the people gave me really good explanations or arguments which i learned from, so i wanted to say thank you before I dive into the next question which will be about a specific situation I was involved in last Monday.

The Story is this: Since the start of the month im working in a supermarket (doing things like packing food into the shelves and stuff. Since I am fairly new I worked together with a young women a few years older than me who showed my how stuff should be done in the supermarket. So far everything is normal, we worked got in a team. While we put the food in the shelves an older couple approached and the man  asked us where a specific item are. She pointed out that it's right in front of him (which i think he really didnt notice, just to lazy to search), to which he answered something along the lines of ""Well, with such a beauty in front of me how could i notice the item"". It was relatively clear that she felt uncomfortable in this situation and he thought he made a genuine compliment (well, maybe should have asked his girlfriend/wife beforehand. She looked pretty uncomfortable too). I just stood there because i didnt really knew what to do.

On one hand I know that it is generally good to call out such behaviour but on the other hand I kind of need my job to not be homeless and i didnt want to act in a patronizing way by assuming she can't handle herself (keep in mind that she is an adult woman who worked at supermarkets for some years by now while i am still an tennager who just started this job and the guy didnt tried to get touchy ou anything).  

Afterwards she told me things like this happen on a semiregular basis with the worst thing that happened being an older custumer who hugged her and kissed her on the cheek without permission. While she ranted about these things I told her that im fully on her side and that such things are not acceptable but i still feel like i could have done things differently and I'm searching some insights in which way i could/should have acted differently.",AskFeminists,1515771064,-Xav,11,5,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7pxan5/what_should_i_have_done_in_this_situation/,2018-01-12

She asserts that men have every right to say no, but she also says that men saying no is a way of asserting power over women/disempowering them by denying them access to the sex they want. So men *can* say no, but is the point that they *shouldn't?* Is she saying that denying women sex is a form of male privilege?

54,Is it okay to exploit a stereotype for personal gain?,"My coworker, who is an outspoken feminist, often seems to lean on stereotypes to get out of physical or menial tasks. 

We both have the same job and we'll both be asked to help with things that are physical like shoveling snow or prepping a huge volume of lab supplies(very repetitive and mundane). However, my coworker will often say that she can't do certain tasks because she doesn't know how, or isn't good at those things, or can't physically do them for some reason. She acts totally clueless and jumps into a helpless-maiden persona. She is by all other standards, VERY good at her job. The most recent example was over the holidays. She was the only one in the office and didn't snow-blow the walkway up to the office, leaving me to do it after the holidays. She claimed she didn't know how to start the snow blower. We were both trained on using the snow blower and it has an electric start to make it extra easy.

I asked some of my feminist friends that love drag shows, and they said it was because gay men were lower on the privilege totem pole, unlike with black face. I pointed out that gay men make more money than women, and still have the advantages of being a man in today's society.

58,What if any deliberate/official different treatment of men and women is acceptable to address earnings gap?,"Inspired by reading this: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/12/harriet-harman-gender-pay-gap-equal-act-saturday-interview

It mentions three potential solutions 

1. ""It would be wildly unrealistic, I (journalist) suggest, to expect every employer to magic up funds for whopping pay rises overnight to all its female employees.""

2. ""One approach she offers will be to effect change through staff turnover. For example, when a man earning £100,000 a year vacates the post, the man who replaces him could find the new salary is £80,000. “The point is, these jobs change hands, so you don’t have to cut men’s pay.”""

3.  ""If one consequence of the act is that employers have a tangible incentive to promote women to positions of power within organisations, it will do much more than merely close the pay gap. “Oh, totally,” Harman agrees. “It is kind of,” and she drops her voice to a stage whisper, “revolutionary.”""

All of these are open to different interpretations, but I think we can take them as 

1. Simply raise women's pay because they're women. This is clearly illegal as you'd have unequal pay for equal work. Do you think it should be legal?

2. Change wider elements of how pay works because it will help equalise gender pay (e.g. reduce top pay if most people at the top are men: another example I've heard in the public sector is that senior men are often paid more because they are more likely to come from the private sector and so get paid based on previous salary not central pay scheme, so a feminist I know proposed simply not paying more to get people with external experience

3. Promoting more women to top jobs. I think this would also be illegal in terms of it being an explicit factor, but I'm less sure of the law and suspect companies could claim that they only used it to break ties between 'equally good' candidates (though in practice 99% of the time this is in my experience a convenient lie)

Other options not mentioned are

4. Women-only training/support schemes: still discriminatory but not I believe illegal (though I think the current Google case is challenging this in the US)

5. Wider changes in culture/entitlements to e.g. make part time more attractive, hours more flexible, give equal paternity leave as maternity leave etc. to avoid having a system essentially designed for men who don't really get involved in parenting.


I'd be very interested in thoughts on this: there's obviously a pretty core philosophical question about the legitimacy of deliberate discrimination as an attempt to balance structural inequality, but then some subtleties around that too.

60,What is the patriarchy? How can it be eliminated? What would the system that comes to replace it look like?,"So im trying to get a better understanding of the concept of the patriarchy as the term is used by feminists and a few questions on its elimination.

I understand that it describes some kind of social system or social order. I also know that the term as used is not merely describing the practice of males as heads of family and decent reckoned through male lineage, nor a system of governance which excludes women (though both of these things may factor into it).

So, how should the term patriarchy be understood in the feminist context?  What are the clear signs of its prevalence and predominance and how can its influence be recognised in day to day life? 

I assume that the end of the patriarchy is a non-controversial feminist goal. Given this, what is the primary strategy for eliminating the patriarchy?  What social changes are considered most important or focal for reaching this goal? How will we know when change has been sufficient and that the patriarchy has been eliminated?

Finally, what should we expect the social system that will come to replace it look like? What is the post-patriarchy ideal?

I realise im asking a lot, but I would like to understand the concept and the plan for dealing with it.  I would also like to do this with a minimum of further reading, so I would appreciate not being directed to read dozens of articles or books. I understand that its likely a complex and nuanced subject but all I really am after is the basic outlines and key strategies.

74,My rapist's fans don't know he'll be using their money to come after me legally.,"Hi everyone. I spoke out against and exposed my rapist and abuser, who's my ex-coworker and ex-boyfriend, due to threats and blackmail, in January 2017. He's a youtuber with +600.000 fans, most of them don't know what he's done, and how he'll be using their donations to come after me legally, for naming him.

I know he's doing this to try and financially ruin me, and make it as difficult as possible for me to have him prosecuted (lawyer bills, etc).

I was hospitalised for depression, acute stress disorder, and being suicidal while he threatened and blackmailed me. Diagnosed as autistic, 7 months hospitalised total.

He blackmailed me to keep me silent. Said he would put out a statement to his fans, with halftruths and lies about me. I kept quiet for 6 weeks - until I was moved to a different ward inside the hospital, with better internet. Then, I cut all contact, and made public what was going on, to protect myself, before he could pitch this 'crazy person' story about me.

After I felt forced to speak out, a war started against me. Online anonymous accounts started to claim I was psychotic. All the things he threatened me with he would tell his fans, started to appear in comments online, the moment I spoke out. People said I used drugs around my child, was a whore, slut, etc. Told me to kill myself, all while being hospitalised.

Since #MeToo started, I got a little more support. Most of 2017 I spent fighting bullies however.

The other day another youtuber (AlternateHistoryHub) made me aware of my rapists plans: that he was going after me, legally.

My rapist receives $2,564 a month from his fans on Patreon, and youtube advertisement money. So, enough funding to do this.

His fans don't know he'll be using this money to do this. While my rapist threatened me with a statement to keep me quiet originally, it all appeared to be bluff: the moment I spoke out to protect myself, he said nothing.

He's not made a statement in over a year. His fans called him out for manipulating his subreddit to try and drive hate my way, and keeping silent. He started to ban people (including me, so I couldn't defend myself in his hate subreddit) questioning him, and is not informing his fans what he's doing with his Patreon money.

Every financial supporter is a direct threat to me, so I'm trying to make them aware of what's going on, and why they should drop support.

My rapist has been financially supported by people like billionaire Notch and youtuber Kurzgezagt. 

I reached out to many male youtubers who promoted and supported him, all refused to ask him for a statement, or just simply blocked me when I called them out for staying silent, while I was harassed and threatened online.

Reddit has done little to nothing about this situation. They only deleted one hate post about me in my rapists subreddit where they doxxed me, but refuse to do anything else about the situation, while there is consistent evidence of what he's been doing on reddit.

/r/videos reached out to me about the situation, and did take action however. They found a way to ban my rapists videos: due to votemanipulation.

Still, I need help, but it's difficult to get help. I'm afraid to post referrals to my blogs and posts here with evidence due to doxxing and a witchhunt (message me if you want links) etc, while Reddit consistently allows my rapists subreddit to be used to attack me and incite violence towards me.

Posts I made before on Reddit to address my situation have been deleted, while my rapist can do whatever he wants in his subreddit.

I have a lawyer who's helping me with my legal case, pro deo, but this doesn't cover a lawsuit against me.

I have no idea how to get this story out there and address that he's using his fans for this, and to make people aware of the monster he is. Youtube has censored my rape story video and Twitter put me in Twitterjail this week for speaking out against my rapist (back online however).

Everything in this post, I can back up with evidence, but again: due to Reddit's rules, I must be careful. So if you want the evidence, please message me. 

I would appreciate advice on how to go about this. I'm not going to delete anything I put online - just so you know.

76,"If the wage gap exists, why aren't companies hiring qualified women at a discount?","Basic wage gap claim: women make 77% of what men make (literally taken by averaging incomes across the genders). 

My question: assuming this is 100% true, and women are being paid less then men for equal work, why would a company hire any men when women can do the exact same job, same quality and everything, but for less money? It doesn't seem to make mathematical sense.

 Consider illegal immigrants that come to work for less than minimum wage in the US. Assuming they do the same quality of work as a US citizen (They probably work harder but anyway), they take less money and thus employers are more inclined to hire lower wage workers (ignore legal problems for now) then the higher wage ones. It's the class south park ""They took our jobs"" argument. 

So based on that logic, companies will prefer to hire employees who accept less wages for the same productive output. If the wage gap is true, why would a company even bother hiring men when there are hundreds and thousands of talented and qualified women who will do the job for less?

82,A few questions about consent,"In light of the recent Aziz Ansari allegations I've been thinking about how consent works (and how it should work) and I have a few questions for which I'd like to hear the feminist answers to. I don't really want to discuss this case specifically, just consent in general. The aspect that interests me the most is that many people's reflexive response is ""she should have said no or left"", and this response is often labelled as victim blaming.

Now, setting aside consent for a moment (this wouldn't be an issue if consent was clearly established), why is it somehow unsavory to expect a woman in a situation like this (willingly engaging in a sexual act that she doesn't actually want to engage in) to stop/leave/say no? This is where I would put the border between an awkward sexual encounter and sexual assault: if one of the parties says ""no, stop, I don't want to do this"" and the other continues - it's sexual assault, if they're only trying to somehow signal their discomfort (which the other party may not notice or interpret correctly) - it's an awkward sexual encounter. Assuming of course that there is no coercion. I believe classifying the latter as sexual assault cheapens actual sexual assaults/rapes. Is this, in your view, wrong? If so, how?

If I read something as enthusiastic yet implicit and/or non-verbal consent but my assessment is incorrect (there is no consent), yet my partner doesn't oppose clearly/verbally, has this encounter now turned into a rape? Wouldn't it be much more reasonable to teach people to explicitly and verbally rebuff unwanted approaches?

85,Can we talk about Aziz Ansari?,"Thanks in advance, this is really fucking with me.

Condemnation of Ansari seems to rest on the assumption that he did know or should have known what the woman's boundaries were. She actually says in the article that he may not have known about her discomfort. OK, so should he reasonably have known?

She says her ""nonverbal cues"" consisted of ""mumbling"", stopping the movements of her hand (keeping still instead of caressing while kissing?) and ""going cold"". I've been with at least one trauma survivor who displayed those exact behaviors because she was uncomfortable about her body and sexuality and sex for her involved a lot of internal processing. This woman actually became more uncomfortable and stressed when I would stop to check in on her mental state because it drew attention to this and made her feel abnormal.

There are a wide variety of reasons why first encounters can be awkward and plenty of personal issues like body consciousness, uncertain sexuality, past trauma and any number of other factors can produce those exact behaviors in people who do want to be doing the things they are doing. I don't agree that what we are given in the article describes ""clear nonverbal cues"", which means that I don't agree that he should have known her mental state, thus I disagree that he can be definitively called coercive or even insensitive, just not-sensitive to something she wasn't expressing in a way that was understood.

So, her feelings are certainly negative, but I don't think that this makes her a victim (or at least *his* victim), and I disagree that her feelings make his actions misdeeds. Misdeeds would require that he did or should have known something that I don't think it's obvious he did or should have known.

We aren't given a description of actions that I would call clear nonverbal cues (stopping his hands, moving away, putting on clothes), and in fact, given that she did participate, it's not even clear whether she feigned some degree of enthusiasm, which would make it even less reasonable to expect him to know how she felt with a sufficient degree of certainty to crucify him publicly.

87,Affirmative Action For Male Veterinarians,"Hi all! I used the search function, but didn't find this topic discussed. My apologies if it is a repost, if anyone would be so kind as to direct me to the original I'd be much appreciated. 

Have a review of this: 

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/08/sydney-university-under-fire-for-vet-scholarship-giving-preference-to-males

The gist? Sydney University offers a male-only scholarship for vets (a field with a 90/10 female/male split). Now, I'm generally critical about affirmative action, but my views aren't relevant (just stating my biases). 

I was concerned by remarks a student made against the scholarship:

&gt; The student said that though there were more women in the veterinary medicine program than men, there were more structural barriers to their advancing in the profession.

&gt; There was also a gender pay gap, compounded by fewer women in senior positions.

&gt; It’s poorly thought out, their reasoning. They’re not addressing gender inequality in an intelligent way, and I think the university should be held to a higher standard.

&gt; Imogen Grant, said ... that there was no excuse for the university to be “complacent about discrimination”

&gt; “The way I think about it, affirmative action should only apply to people who have structural barriers to receiving an education""

As feminism is diverse as any other school of thought, what are your individual opinions on this? 

What sort of evidence would need to be brought forward to show that men have structural discrimination that would warrant affirmative action? Or do we even need to bring evidence? Isn't the 90/10 split enough? 

EDIT: I personally think this is a little cold and selfish. As stated, I don't like affirmative action on the best of days, but to be told by affirmative-action proponents that I don't deserve help because I'm a male is insulting and demeaning in the extreme. I'd trust that the majority of you cannot agree with such a notion...but I guess I'll see if I'm right?

Anyway, it ended terribly and I think a lot of people on the thread (including family members) hate me now. One messaged me privately and made some demands of me.

""you do not have the right to question people of color or women or immigrants about their experiences because they're not experiences you will ever have.""

So if people could break down what this means exactly, it would be greatly appreciated. I assume it doesn't mean ""believe POC/women/etc about everything"". I assume it is at least more limited to ""believe POC/women/etc about their respective issues""? But even that can't be true because they do not have a single view on things.

92,Confused about feminism.,"So my girlfriend is very Liberal and is a Feminist. I personally don't care for feminism and many other movements going on around America. However, I will agree that women deserve equality. Anyways we got into a discussion about Feminism and we got to the topic of of ""She was asking for it"". She kept going on how about how they aren't asking to be raped because of what they are wearing or insinuating. Example: An attractive women is at a party or club. She is wearing highly revealing clothing in an environment where there are plenty of males. This woman knows the situation she is in and she knows she is being sexy and revealing. My GF tries to explain to me that she may just trying to be sexy and or pretty for HERSELF. Not trying to attract the attention of males in the vicinity. Yet it is some how our fault if we go up to her and try to talk to her. 

The problem I was mainly having is how it proceeds to rape. Do not get me wrong, I think rape is a terrible thing to be succumbed to and it is an awful experience to have happen to you. She said I was being nit-picky when I gave her a scenario. But from doing a little research, I find that a lot of these accusations have a similar scenario. Example: She is wearing revealing clothes (or not) at a club/party and a male approaches her. Both probably being intoxicated, hit it off and head back to either of there homes. Things get steamy and they end up having sex. She later wakes up and regrets the decision THEY have made. And since it is apparently always the males fault she can easily say she was sexually assaulted and or raped by this male. There is almost nothing this male can say to try and prove that he is innocent other than, ""We were intoxicated and we both consented in some way."" Of course if he FORCED himself on her and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her while she was physically resisting, then yes that would be considered rape.

However she would not argue the fact of how a woman would be put in the position to be raped in the first place. He obviously did not drag her out of the club, force her into his or her car and or Uber. Drag her into his or her room, throw her on the bed and force fuck her.

Another thing that I thought was pretty contradicting in our little debate was when we were at a store. I noticed a woman wearing a very short skirt, short sleeved top that showed her torso and had no jacket on. Keep in mind it is 20f outside. I said to my GF, ""Damn she has to be cold wearing those clothes"". She instantly followed up with, ""hoes don't get cold."" I was like wow, you just straight up called her a hoe but if I said that you would have gasped at me and told me I was being judgmental and discriminating her. She told me that, ""We can say that because girl code"". Like, what? It is okay for another woman to be judgmental against another woman but if I, a male say the same thing I am the worst person on the planet?

97,"When is it right to speak up about past abusers, and what is the best way (in terms of societal impact) to go about it?","I've been thinking a lot about this lately, especially in light of the revelations about Aziz Ansari and the renewed emphasis on enthusiastic consent.  It's made me realize that a similar pattern used to play out in a previous relationship of mine, where my partner would often ask for sex (especially if she was having any sort of cramps/discomfort), and I would usually go along with it just to assuage her, even though I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about it.

Frankly, the more I think about it, the more it makes me feel gross and violated.  I know that on a personal level, the best I can do is learn from it and be more vocal in calling out coercive behavior with future partners.  But I don't really know the best way to address her abusive behavior more broadly.  I feel like a Facebook callout is unlikely to be of any use to anyone she may harm in the future, since we don't share social circles.  I've thought about writing to her employer, especially given that she works with kids, just because they may be in more of a position to force her to focus more on consent practices and healthy verbalization, but even that isn't really guaranteed to help anyone.

109,"What is ""access to power""?","Men's issues are often dismissed as not ""real sexism"" because they are part of a system that supposedly privileges males overall. Whenever this assumption of privilege is questioned, feminists usually fall back on the sociological definition of privilege as ""access to power"".

""Access to power"" seems like a very vague term and a very vague basis for shutting down alternative views. So my question is: what does ""access to power"" mean?

Why do female advantages not qualify as ""access to power""? For example, when female victims have vastly more domestic violence shelters despite evidence that there is also a large population of male victims, why is that not an example of women having more ""access to power""? When a mother has an advantage in getting custody, why is that not female ""access to power""? When women have a mainstream mass movement advocating for their issues and men don't, why is that not female ""access to power""? And so on.

If your answer is that female advantages come with disadvantages in other areas of life, couldn't the same be said of male advantages? For example a man in the military might have the advantage of getting more respect or a medal or something, but it comes with the disadvantage that he might get killed.

If ""access to power"" is solely about the demographics of people in top positions, how would you distinguish your position from that of an anti-Semite who claims that Jews have more ""access to power"" because there are a disproportionate number of Jews at the top in media and banking?",AskFeminists,1516199118,serpentineeyelash,86,6,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7r1a4u/what_is_access_to_power/,2018-01-17
110,"How do we deep more into the ""ask for consent""?","Hi :)
As all of you know, in our cultural context there are a lot of toxic ideas around sex and consent: a lot of people think that some events (smiling, flirting, kissing, wearing some clothes or going to someone's appartment) directly leads you to kind of owe sex to the other person. 
As a teenager, for example, ""cockteaser"" was a very undesirable and common insult. You could be a cockteaser just by looking a guy in some way.
In all this context, I feel troubled with the ""ask for consent"" advice (although I understand why we need it).

I personally think that a lot of coerced sex happens, not because that guy didn't ask for consent, but because he had this mentality of ""getting the yes"" at any price (and anything that is not a HUGE NO may count as a yes for them). 
I'm afraid a lot of ""yes"" will be said to stop being pressured and to avoid being considered a cockteaser. 

A ""feminist"" guy pressured me for sex after I said ""no"" several days; the last time I had a literal panick attack at his house that made me lay on the floor for hours saying that I didn't know what to do. After that, he said a lot of the right things and he asked for consent in a very kind and sensible way, in e.v.e.r.y sexual act he performed, including beating me.
When I explained how I felt to some close friends, everyone said: there's nothing wrong, he asked for consent. 
At that time I knew nothing about feminism, but I KNEW that something very wrong happened in that relationship. 
I know I also need to learn some things (saying no is ok, I don't owe sex, being more clear, etc.), but what I've thought from my experience is that asking is nothing if he lets the other person know, in some subtle ""correct"" way, that a ""no"" is not a good or acceptable choice.

How do you feel about that?

119,Institutional Sexism - is this a good example?,"I've long had trouble understanding the concept of privilege the way many feminists seem to.  Most of the examples i've seen cited seemed to me (and many others) to be based on gender stereotypes themselves - and on the assumption that the stereotype that applied to men was better.  For example, sometimes it's said that men can have as much sex as they want without being admonished, but this example seemed to me to assume that men always want sex, that they can have sex, and theyre not admonished for not having sex.  

I applied similar logic to institutional power.  Its undeniable men have most positions of power, but it seemed this was only good for men who wanted or could achieve that power.  But I recently realized  another aspect of this privilege: as our societal structure (e.g. economical) is man-made, it's more likely to cater to the needs of men.

The wage gap is often justified as a result of women having children.  Women make a much larger sacrifice for having children.  When our economic system was created (by men), they essentially ignored this extremely basic biological difference, usually requiring women to rely on a man for support.  Moreover, our organizational structures are typically very rigid, culturally.  While some areas try to address through maternity leave, etc., the onus is usually placed on a business, which gives them incentive to discriminate, and taking leave requires the rigid organizations to fill positions with other people.

People may argue that women nowadays, (hopefully) usually can choose to have children.  But the fact remains that a man is not penalized nearly as much for the same choice.  

Am I on to something here?  The example seems like the purest form of sexism I've ever seen and is not supposed to be represented as the only possible form, but the main question is about this being why men are described as privileged?

127,Feminism and cultural sensitivity,"I am a feminist but have a western perspective, which I have often found quite limiting.

While there are some cultures or countries I disagree with in terms of how they limit or treat women (Saudi Arabia, for instance), there are other cultures that aren’t as sever in segregation, but culturally segregate women and men into different categories and inflexible norms. These kind of cultures that have long histories of separating men and women into specific roles, which have been carried to modern society. 

My question is, how does feminism and cultural sensitivity overlap in these instances, and should they? I dislike the idea of criticising culture, but this morally overlaps with my values that focus on equality for all. Is it wrong to question culture from a feminist perspective?

I just hope you reciprocate that feeling (I'm sure all of you are lovely, but unfortunately there are many of those on the internet that simply attack when they hear another opinion.)



Yodiho, far-right libertarian here, and one thing that has stuck out to me about the (modern) feminist movement is the constant shaming of those who don't share the same opinion as them on the same topics. I.E. I believe that abortion should be illegal because I feel as though it is a violation of the rights of the unborn. I don't hold a belief in abortion because I want to tell you what to do with your body, because essentially, I don't really give a damn what you do, however I hold that belief because I don't want you killing what I see as the potentiality for human life, which at that point, I don't consider your body, but another person. Whenever I bring up the topic of abortion, I always get a good amount of people shouting the good ole' ""misogynist"" slur at me, and saying something such as I have no good reason to try to control a woman's body, even though my reasoning is detached from that. Why are people shamed for holding this view?




Another example I could think of right would be the supposed ""glass ceiling."" I don't believe in this, and I don't believe in programs like affirmative action to make decisions based on gender, because I believe they are inherently unfair. I believe that there is little holding women back from being as successful as they wish, and that is from my own personal experiences, and observations. When I express this belief, again, I am met with swift criticism and name-calling, such as the woefully rampant ""misogynist."" I believe that women are no less capable of reaching the same heights as men, however I believe the reason that we don't see complete parity in the workforce is because there are slight differences in the average goals between women and men. Why are people shamed for holding this view?


Another thing, (not essentially related to feminism, but I see the topic of ethnicity go along a lot when speaking with feminists) is what do you think of the left's attitude as if it has a monopoly on minority opinions. Myself as a Hispanic male, find it patronizing when I tune onto media platforms and see the left especially talking in a way as if they know what is best for me, as if I can't make a decision on my own.

141,"At what point does the phrase, “I am a feminist” ring true?","I’m sorry in advance, but this is another fucking Aziz Ansari thread (sort of).  I’m sorry I’m adding onto the pile so late, but I live in Hawai’i, and we have had [slightly different priorities](http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/13/breaking-news/emergency-officials-mistakenly-send-out-missile-threat-alert/) over the last week.

I want to preface this with, this is not a place to discuss whether or not Ansari did a bad thing.  He did.  Everything that follows assumes that he did.  Instead, I want to discuss Ansari’s public-facing role as a feminist, and an ally of feminism.

One of the articles I’ve read since the dust has settled here, on the Aziz Ansari situation, is [this Jezebel piece](https://jezebel.com/babe-what-are-you-doing-1822114753/amp) about the reporting and how it impacted the broader message.  Within it is a quote that is sort of central to my question:

&gt;In Grace’s case, she is a decade younger than Ansari, just starting her career, and not famous—three facts that, in a more just situation, might have made Ansari more sensitive to the contours of their interaction. (That he apparently was not says a lot about the chasm between the actual practice of feminism, and the ease of simply calling yourself one.)

This is actually the reason I refuse to call myself a feminist, or an ally, or anything of that sort.  Saying “I am a feminist” is easy; actually being truthful to feminist principles is significantly harder.  More important that, however, is that I am not the arbiter of my own allyship: I don’t get to decide for another person that I am their ally, and declare to them that I am a person that can be trusted.  Rather, it is my responsibility to walk the walk as best I can, and just show others I am trying to help and be supportive through my actions, rather than tell them.  In fact, I am somewhat skeptical of others (especially men) who boldly announce their feminism without anything substantive to it; I think wolves in sheep’s clothing are more dangerous than the naked wolf, because it erodes confidence in others who look and act like them, wolf or not.  So, I am suspicious of others who are trying to wear the label, and cautious not to ascribe it to myself.

I can’t imagine what it is like on the other side of this stance, however.  It seems like, to succeed at its goals, feminism (like any other ideology or agent of change) needs broader outreach, but this outreach meets lots of barriers, such as people falsely identifying with your ideals, for convenience or social benefit or whatever, as well as people refusing to identify, due to opposition or misinformation or social pressure.  Outside of obvious, explicit allies, it seems like it would be harder to figure out who and where your allies are.  I imagine that, especially in times where anti-feminists are identifying, organizing, and using subversive social tactics on a higher profile than before, some form of internal vetting process has to happen.

Which brings me to the actual questions: **Is there a point where someone could say, “I am a feminist/ally,” and you would be more inclined to believe them than not?**  Have you ever had that moment where you take a [good, long look](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0O9zareSGZoeC7gk/giphy.gif) at someone and said, “alright, checks out”?  I have only been here once or twice before, but I recognize a couple recurring names here from last time; have any of you had that moment regarding other regulars, for better or worse?

Returning, for a moment, to Aziz Ansari: **Do you believe that, as a result of this incident, you have lost a public ally?  Or did you ever actually consider Ansari an ally to begin with?  Did you ever have that “checks out” assessment of Ansari before this incident?**  I know he wore the pin and said some things at an event, and that was part of what prompted “Grace” to tell her story, but I’ll be honest—I can’t tell Community from Parks &amp; Recreation.  I know he’s in one of them.  I can’t think of anything really significant he’s done that would affirm his support; just the small, convenient things that, well, I assume a lot of people in Hollywood just do (how do you feel about these others doing this, in general?).

145,Is there any value in Christian-style chastity?,"The Christian religion has two key tenets when it comes to sexual mores (granted there are lots of interpretations of Christianity, but these tend to be fairly uncontroversial among Christians).  Obviously, the religion itself teaches these ideas alongside a lot of metaphysics and transcendent morality, but you need not be a follower of a religion to be able to consider its ideas.  I also think some other religions share some similar concepts I just happen to know Christianity the best.

Christianity's two key tenets regarding sexuality are as follows:

1. You should make no sexual advances on and engage in no sexual conduct with any individual to whom you are not married.
2. You should not even consider another person in a lustful or sexually desirous way unless that person is your spouse.

Obviously, the first logically proceeds from the second, but I think they can be thought of separately as well.

The first tenet is not a panacea on its own.  Marital rape is a real thing and it is a profound evil.  This tenet must be combined with healthy societal customs surrounding marriage.  However, we should not kid ourselves, if all of the people we have been hearing about in the news, Weinstein, Spacey, Lauer, Louis C.K., and even Ansari, had followed this single rule there would have been no problems.

The key here, I think, is really the second tenet.  The second tenet requires individuals never to consider one another as sexual objects or simply as means of sexual gratification.  You would not create a work environment or leverage your influence for sexual gain over an individual for whom you harbor no sexual desires.  In short, it demands that we treat one another as people first and not as objects of sexual gratification.

It seems to me that these two tenets provide much more clear and concise guidance than does parsing the contextual meaning of consent, enthusiastic consent, power dynamics, and the like; the object being to draw the moral line someplace other than mutual desire alone because that line can be so fraught.

What do you folks think?  Is this a useful solution; how should it be different?

146,Evaluating the relevancy of formal 'consent' when it comes to sex trafficking vs prostitution,"According to the PROTOCOL TO PREVENT, SUPPRESS AND PUNISH TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN, SUPPLEMENTING THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME http://www.osce.org/odihr/19223 : 

""For the purposes of this Protocol:

(a) “Trafficking in persons” shall mean the recruitment,
transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the
threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of
deception, **of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the
giving or receiving of payments or benefits** to achieve the consent of a
person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.
Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the
prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or
services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of
organs;

(b) **The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the
intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be
irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been
used**;""

Taking into consideration the emphasized parts from the protocol, it means that formal consent to sexual activity is irrelevant when it is achieved through abuse of power or position of vulnerability. Given that most prostitutes are women, and that most of them are poor, and that most would prefer to exit that 'industry' - does this not mean that men are guilty of rape when they 'buy' sexual access to poor women working as prostitutes out of necessity? If it does not mean that, then why the double standard regarding sexual trafficking of poor women (where their consent, coming from a position of abused vulnerability, is irrelevant)?",AskFeminists,1516385041,confshield,10,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7rk70w/evaluating_the_relevancy_of_formal_consent_when/,2018-01-19

150,Are people allowed to engage in sex where they themselves are less enthusiastic about it but they may choose sex despite their reservations?,"
Twice, I've done it. 

1)  I was flirting with a guy online who lived in a different town. We had know each other casually for a couple of years. I travelled to see him and the chemistry in person wasn't there. 

I still ended up having sex with him because I didn't mind indulging him. There was no pressure on his part and it was mediocre sex and it re-enforced that we weren't into each other.  (Cold pizza is better than no pizza). We didn't regretted it but it wasn't enthusiastic by any measure.

2) Perhaps because of self-esteem issues, I had sex with a guy who was attractive a few times despite the fact that his personality was a little creepy. I was trying to determine if I could carve out a relationship with him.

He never pressured me or threatened me. I was never obligated to have sex with him. I wasn't 100% comfortable with him (although I was certainly attracted to him). It's hard to characterize those encounters as ""enthusiastic"".

I just feel like there are edge cases that ""Enthusiastic Consent"" doesn't seem to cover. At what point does a person's own agency override social rules?

As a feminist, I often hear criticism that we want to derail justice and lock up those accused of rape, sexual assault, etc. without a fair trial. I’ve always defended our movement and said that we just want more women (and men) to come forward so their claims can be fairly investigated. Unfortunately, it seems like I was *dead wrong*, at least in Canada.

171,"Metrics of Power in ""The Myth of Male Power""","Hello! throwaway because I just don't want anything political on my main account (just don't want to get into arguments and have people following me, etc...).

For a school assignment, I decided to read Warren Farrell's ""The Myth of Male Power."" In the first chapter, he offers some metrics that he argues could be a measure of power. I am curious as to your thoughts on them. In addition to broad thoughts, I would like to know: 

1. Do you believe these to be valid metrics (why/why not)

2. Are there better metrics you would propose? Why would you consider those metrics better?

Sorry for the length of this question.

-----------------

First, he uses ""Life Expectancy As a Way of Seeing Who Has the Power

Females (white) 79 

Females (black) 74 

Males (white) 72 

Males (black) 65""

He continues and uses ""SUICIDE AS POWERLESSNESS 

Just as life expectancy is one of the best indicators of power, suicide is one of the best indicators of powerlessness. 

ITEM. Until boys and girls are 9, their suicide rates are identical; 

—from 10 to 14, the boys’ rate is twice as high as the girls’; 

—from 15 to 19, four times as high; and

—from 20 to 24, six times as high.

ITEM. As boys experience the pressures of the male role, their suicide rate increases 25,000 percent. 8 

ITEM. The suicide rate for men over 85 is 1,350 percent higher than for women of the same age group.""

He then uses networth as a metric of power, where he says basically that for heads of families men and women are similar (citing the census bureau which found female heads of household made 93% of a male head of household) he continues by arguing that it is fairly comparable and while women tend to earn less men tend to have greater spending obligations. 

He continues by citing spending power as wealth noting that not only do women tend to spend much more, but many more products are aimed at them and ""Both sexes buy more for women. The key to wealth is not in what someone earns; it is in what is spent on ourselves, at our discretion— or in what is spent on us, at our hint.""

He goes on to cite ""influence power"" arguing that women have a great deal of power over children. He says ""The Catholic church is often quoted as acknowledging, “Give us a child the first five years and we will shape its life.” We acknowledge the influence power of the church over its youth; we often ignore the influence power of a mother over her children— including her sons. But it is the mother who can make the child’s bedtime earlier, take away desserts, or ground the child if it doesn’t obey. It is the hand that rocks the cradle that creates the child’s everyday heaven or hell. Few men have similar influence.""

He goes on to cite: ""CONTROL-OVER-LIFE POWER""

He says: 
""Influence power, though, is not real power. If we told mothers, “The more children you have, the more power you will have,” they would laugh. If we then said, “The more children you have, the more everyone will love you and respect you,” the mother would feel pressured, not empowered. But when we tell men, “The more people you supervise, the more power you will have,” they buy it. Real power does not come from caving in to pressure to expand obligations, it comes from controlling our own life. 

Historically, a husband spent the bulk of his day under the eye of his boss— his source of income; a wife did not spend the bulk of her day under the eye of her husband— her source of income. She had more control over her work life than he had over his.""

He then cites ""SECURITY POWER"" arguing women have greater income security and get more protection from the law.

He continues with ""“MY BODY, MY CHOICE” POWER 

In the 1990s, if a woman and man make love and she says she is using birth control but is not, she has the right to raise the child without his knowing he even has a child, and then to sue him for retroactive child support even ten to twenty years later (depending on the state). This forces him to take a job with more pay and more stress and therefore earlier death. Although it’s his body, he has no choice. He has the option of being a slave (working for another without pay or choice) or being a criminal. Roe v. Wade gave women the vote over their bodies. Men still don’t have the vote over theirs— whether in love or war. ""

Next, he uses ""THE POWER OF APPRECIATION"" arguing ""We were more aware of one man doing harm than of two men saving; of one man threatening one woman who is still physically alive than of dozens of men saving hundreds of people and two of those men being dead.""

175,"Is the ""male gaze"" inherently negative? Does it differ from the ""female gaze?""","I was recently reading, of all things, an essay/commentary on Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and the author mentioned that they believed the sequel trilogy is being written for the female gaze. Presumably, they seem to mean this in the sense that the assumed audience is female rather than a heterosexual man with the male gaze. Now regardless of whether anyone agrees that this is the case for TLJ it got me thinking.


Most of the time I see the phrase male gaze used it is something that is assumed to be negative. Yet in the case of the article the female gaze is portrayed as something either good or neutral (and having enjoyed the film I wouldn't disagree). Additionally, commentary on the male gaze often connects it to sexual objectification while the female gaze is primarily focused on the basic concepts of assumed audience or a director/writers gender. Even the wikipedia entries differ in that the one for male gaze specifically mentions it it depicting the world from a male pov in which women are presented as objects of pleasure. Also, in some of these discussions the male gaze also seems to extend beyond it's origin in visual arts/literature and into society as a whole. 

Now on to the questions. All of this being said is the male gaze inherently negative in and of itself? Does it necessarily include objectification? Does the female gaze include objectification as well and it's just not seen as negative because of how uncommon films from the female gaze are? Or maybe is the male gaze only negative because it is so ubiquitous? Lastly, what is the ideal end goal in film when it comes to gazes? Neutral gazes across most films? Or simply a more even split of films intended for male and female gazes?

178,"Help, I feel more and more disconnected from feminism?","Hi! I’ll try to keep this short but no promises! (And sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile)

Mostly it may be long because this is kinda confusing and hard to explain even to myself, much less typed out. It may seem weird to preface this with this fact, but it’s relevant to know that I’m white. 

So I would consider myself a feminist in the egalitarian sense. (If you have strong opinions on that part in itself, might wanna just pass on this post, idk.) I surround myself with strong women when I can in life but truthfully I often look to women on social media for influence on these ideas. 

In particular I follow two women of color on Instagram, who I’ve been following for a long time, who speak openly and often about feminism/women’s rights/other social issues. I really like all their content, except lately I’ve been feeling a little... off. 

They champion civil rights all the time and the conversation often involves the concept of race. They talk about how POC have experienced X and should focus on being more Y in the future, etc. 

My issue isn’t with this part, but more to the fact that at the same time, they in particular seem to poke fun at/bad talk white people in general. Like one of them posted this really lengthy and thoughtful commentary about WOC and then promptly posted a really mocking meme about “white boys,” or something. 

I just feel weird about it. One of these women attended the recent Women’s March and posted about how she left early because she felt uncomfortable from all the “white feminism” there. And was saying we don’t need average white girls with trendy hashtags written on signs screaming tired feminist dialogue. 

I feel more and more alienated by these two “feminists” who I have followed and loved for a long time. I don’t know if I’m just feeling this because I’m sensitive or being defensive or something? I just feel like I once identified in the same group as these women, and they are slowly but surely closing ranks against me, a white feminist. 

Again, sorry this is kinda all convoluted and maybe not clear. I tried to talk to my boyfriend about it but he said he “doesn’t know much about this kind of stuff,” and thinks I’m just overreacting. I mean, it isn’t ruining my life or anything, I just am in my early twenties and this kind of thing makes me question my identity a little.

186,Question about how to be more intersectional.,"Okaaaay so I pride myself on striving to be as intersectional a feminist as I know how to be, but I could use some help. Specifically with the backlash about the Women’s March and specifically Pussy Hats. I get that they’re supposed to be a symbol of white feminism and are somehow transphobic, but I really don’t get it. I am a femme/sort of genderqueer person (I’m working on figuring that out) but I am not trans, so maybe that’s why I don’t make the connection between the pussy hat and transphobia. 

I as a (at the very last) gender non conforming person don’t see what about the hat is wrong. Sure, not all vaginas are pink and not all women have vaginas, but what about people who have vaginas that aren’t necessarily women? What about people who just have a vagina and it has shaped their experiences in some way? Am I supposed to be ashamed to have a vagina? Is talking about and advocating for my body and my rights white feminism just because I am also a white person? How do I advocate for myself and for others without involving white feminism?

I’ve never had a person tell me I’m a white feminist because I really try to always be educating myself, but on this one I haven’t been able to find an argument that really resonates with me. So please, share your thoughts. I don’t want to get stuck in a toxic way of thinking, but I also don’t want to ignore myself in the process.

191,"I would like to purge my mind of the ""feminism to win conversations"" types of people you find on the internet.

It's sort of a juvenile word, but the idea makes sense. The type of ""feminism to win conversations"" people I'm talking about are these infantry level folks who use the term to shut people up. One time a genius accused me of mansplaining on reddit. *How the fuck was I supposed to guess their gender?* They guessed mine though.

I don't know many active feminists and I'm sure that's not unheard of in areas where most people are stable, suburban, and apolitical if not conservative. So most of the feminism I encounter is not the serious intelligent people I knew in college. It's these creatures who live on the internet and win conversations for momentary power at the cost of alienating everyone. There's also ""commercial feminism"" like these marketing department vanguards who coopt everything.

It's *extremely* draining. It takes my full intelligence to separate the good from the bad. A part of me is really fed up with visible elements of women's advancement. I have to go ""Now now, women's advancement isn't all about movie stars and trolls"". But I live a fairly conventional life, and about 100% of my exposure is about consumer media and internet morons.

To that end, I would like to obtain a ""comfort book"" to remind myself that there are intelligent feminists out there who would take even the most toxic interaction and not feed into it.

My kind of book would be analytical and theoretical. It would not mix expression of political angst with analysis. It would be problem-focused more than solution-focused. It would be general enough that I could stumble on a thought of my own that is reasonably salient and I could go ""Hm, I wonder what my book has to say about that"". A book that collects ideas and topics rather than developing the author's own may be better if it is more easily general that way.

I have Carol Pateman's The Sexual Contract from a college class. I also have The Second Sex. The latter for me is more out-of-date and historical than I'd like.

1,How do I tell if I was a chauvinist or my GF was being selfish?,"Hello dear feminists of Reddit, first of all, I know relationship advise has other subs to be handled. But since I ended being called a male chauvinist - which is a thing I despise- I decided to ask you guys to tell me where I am wrong and what was the correct course of action. Also, English is not my first language, so there might be some mistakes in my writing. And go easy, please. 
Here is what happened:

Me and my GF woke up in the morning and she started teasing me. I began some foreplay on her and continued until she climaxed. Then she didn't want to continue doing anything, she just turned to the side and slept.

Now, I don't mind giving without taking. In fact I do that a lot, did so in the night before. Actually, I am the one always giving and never taking. I can't remember a time in the past years where I actually received any sex-play without doing anything in return. But I don't mind pleasing her. We usually stop sex when she is satisfied or don't want to continue, and I respect that.

Well, in this particular morning it got me frustrated. I wanted to have sex. Or something. I wanted to climax too, and felt she was being selfish. So It got me kind bothered. She knew but didn't mind to talk, she decided just to get pissed with me instead.

Later she argued with me on the phone, said I don't know what it is like being a woman, that I was being a male chauvinist for being pissed because I didn't get to have sex, that many times when we're having sex she is not into it but she goes on because I'm having fun. I'm thankful to her but I doubt a bit that women don't enjoy sex too.

So it got me thinking and sad. I don't want to be a chauvinist, but I want  sex/sex-play too. I can't really see where I'm wrong, except in wanting to have sex. So I ask you girls what I am doing wrong and what should I be doing instead?

My stance specifically is that I don't think the prosecution should bear the burden of proving a lack of consent. Its certainly harder to prove a negative, and I also feel its fundamentally unfair to the victim for a few reasons: 

1) you know your own mental state better than anyone else. If you are saying that you did not want to have sex with that person, then that should be sufficient proof of it and now it's the defenses turn to rebut. 

2) if the sex was consensual, then you are in a better position to document or prove the consent because you were prepared for it, you can choose when and where to have sex, and how you react afterwards. If it was non consensual, its really coming as a complete surprise, and you're going to be in a horrible mental state afterwards, its not surprising if you don't do everything perfect to document what happened.


I would seek to treat it as an affirmative defense, something that has to be raised and proved by the defendant.

Here is my ideal society. I'd like to see this type of world for my future child (want a family soon):

Children are not separated by sex other than to use restrooms and locker rooms. Otherwise, a child's sex is irrelevant (the school system may already be leaning this way... Not sure, it's been awhile since I was in school.) But this should include the elimination of gendered uniforms.

Women's history covered thoroughly in schools (to include the history of the witch hunts, history of women's oppression throughout the world, history of female fashion, history of women's sexuality)

Female anatomy and biology thoroughly and accurately covered in school

Self esteem and body image as part of health education in school

A HUGE change in the media and hopefully some laws that begin to restrict the allowance of objectification in the media (and the acknowledgement of airbrushing/Photoshop when used in advertising)

Elimination of beauty pageants, programs like the Victoria's secret fashion show

Strip clubs and ""breastaurants"" made illegal

Restrictions on the accessibility and production of pornography (ideally, it would be illegal to produce and distribute video pornography)

The encouragement of all people to dress, act, and present themselves in whatever manner represents their individuality, regardless of their sex

Some progress in regard to childcare for working mothers. For office buildings with over x amount of employees to be required to have an on site facility (where employees could pay to have their children watched) would be so amazing. Or, if it is a job that could allow an employee to work from home, the option for mothers of children under x years old to do so.

I have consulted a lot of feminist sites and have found that the term ""male tears"" is quite popular. 

I immediately thought that talking about men's problems was more or less forbidden.

Since then, I have taken a step back and I prefer to ask feminists directly what they think of it.

So I have a few questions.

1-What exactly does the term ""male tears"" mean and under what circumstances is it used?

2-How to talk about the problems faced by men in the right way ?

Is a teenage girl posting a hashtag and lecturing her friends about internalized misogyny as much of a feminist as someone marching for reproductive rights in hostile territory? I think feminism needs to be an activist movement, not just a philosophy.

You might've heard of Berta Caseres, SHE was an environmentalist who was murdered for her beliefs. My buying solar charges and sharing articles about Global Warming just doesn't compare.

37,Isn't Asian fever a myth?,"I think it's the other way around. While is may be true that in culture , Asian women are portrayed and sexualized in a certain way, the majority of white men in no way adopt or perpetuate this. Something like 40% of Asian women marry white men. White men marry Asian women at nowhere near that level . And this is odd since men are generally equal opportunity in who they fuck, and women are generally more racist. But  it is reversed. Personally , I feel it's more to do with demographics as to why Asian women do this consistently, with a little bit of white worshipping on the side for some of them, but I think it's completely false to say the same thing about white men. As an Asian woman, her anecdotes and experiences of Asian men fetishizing her may seem abound, but it really isn't.  At less than 5% of the population , When you're one of very few Asian people in you town , people who have that fetish will be far more apparent. It's like me being the only black man in a club full of white people when I go out. Women with an extreme fetish for black men will immediately make their interest known.

He tries WAY too hard. He would always tell you how horrible cis men are. He would wonder how can women be attracted to straight guys. He gets super vicious when confronting sexism, doesn't matter how mild it is.

He's more or less femme himself. Online he'd use cutesy anime/pony avatars and lots of emotes, and do affectionate stuff you might do with your female friends. IRL he's like that saccharine guy who's a ""hugger"" and nearly worships women.

I'm asking because over the years I've been involved with a few men like that (or more accurately, they have been involved with me) and they've always made me subtly uncomfortable on a level I can't explain. They've been super respectful and never harassed me or anything like that, but they've all been sort of obsessed with me. Like texting me often, giving me way too much attention, but never anything I can comfortably call out without feeling like I'm the asshole.

It's all subtle enough to make me feel like I'm just biased/sexist and I shouldn't have a problem with a guy who does these things. But I do, and I don't know why. It's like I'm just unnerved on an intuitive level and I can't tell if it's legitimate or something I'm just imagining.

40,Disagreement with women and minorities - always oppressive?,"I often see it played out. A feminist or gender issue article is posted and then on social media a real battle of the sexes erupts between feminist women and males harbouring resentment towards feminism one way or another. An intense row with a lot of hostility, rancour, bad faith, accusations and insults hurled at each other.

Sooner or later, someone who is a woman (or a member of any minority group if things get more intersectional) asserts that men disagreeing with them are purely motivated by resentment of women having a voice and thus their intent is to silence women! Now how often is this actually true? 

Because if a woman makes a claim which I find a bit dubious, then I'd like to think that a) I'm only resenting her rhetoric and her identity is irrelevant and b) just because a person is female doesn't mean she gets to make strange claims without opposition. But apparently the  official party line seems to be that men disagreeing only want to silence these women.

Surely there's got to be a way to disagree with the more dubious claims made by women and minorities without coming across as a raging bigot. So my question is, what leeway is actually there?

41,"Gender Roles, Breadwinners and Ableism","When we talk about dismantling gender roles, why is the traditional role of men having the job and being a financial provider considered exempt?

I'm particularly bothered by the way men on disability welfare are viewed - even by ""progressive"" people - as failing to meet the requirements of their gender role.

I go to a support group  for people who are not working due to their disability. All of the women there have no trouble finding interested men (or women in some cases). All the women have partners except for two who are over retirement age and have decided they are no longer interested in dating.

None of the heterosexual disabled men there have partners.

One of the guys is still actively trying, but most of us have given up. In the UK and Australia, if you're on disability welfare and you move in with a working partner you will lose your disability welfare. I assume it's just as bad if not worse in the US. 

Apart from how dehumanizing it is for the disabled person to lose their financial independence, it is almost impossible to find a woman willing to accept a guy who will be financially dependent on them when they move in.

TLDR: Because of traditional gender roles some men are willing to consider dating a woman who won't contribute financially, but hardly any women are willing to date a partner who does not work and has limited future prospects for work. Why isn't this considered archaic, and something our society needs to get over?

I didn't get to come around to read her book until now, and not when it got very Tumblr-and-instagram-famous among celebrity feminists, because it seemed very gimmicky and trendy. There are things that I really enjoy and love about her social media presence and article, and some things that are very annoying, but I'm not saying that it discredits her feminism or anything. Just some dilemmas I have about ""social media celebrities"" in general and not with feminism. I'm curious how you saw her writing and her ideas in general, and if you personally feel differently from me or just one way or another, and her contribution to the feminist movement.

Some points I personally felt about her writings and ideas:

Positive

-I relate to her writing as a woman of color

-I am happy to see a woman of color writer gain positive attention

-I think her ideas and voice about self-love, and bodily agency, while enjoying sex, is very important to women and women of color, especially women who have grown up listening to oppressive cultural voices

-Her being vocal about sexual expression and bodily functions is very crucial, especially to young women

Negative

-At the same time, it's not like we have to praise every writing just because it's from a woman or a woman of color (although I believe the voice in itself is important)

-Her poems do seem kind of borrowed from a lot of other texts, and it is a little bit jarring to see her claim them as her own

-Her idea of portraying women as some sort of an ""earth mama"" with the ""power of our uterus"" is patriarchal and trans-exclusive, not to mention honestly, toxic and fetishizing

-The ""period power"" idea that she seems to portray is also patriarchal, biological, and trans-exclusive, and adds to the fetishizing of women, especially women of color",AskFeminists,1514602673,missmalibugoth,2,6,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7mz360/what_do_you_think_of_rupi_kaur_and_her_writings/,2017-12-29

47,Is it okay for me to wear a dress?,"I'm a cis hetero guy and I'd like to start wearing dresses occasionally, mostly when I perform my music at local pubs. I'm wondering if this may be seen as damaging to the cause of feminism though? 

Here are the reasons I'd like to start doing it: 

1) When men like feminine things it is commonly seen as a bad thing by lots of other men. I'd like to protest that. 

2) When I was younger I was always made fun of for being skinny, weak, not masculine enough. When I worked at a restaurant a while back, the guys in the kitchen told me they thought I was gay for the first 3 months until my wife came in. Of course it wasn't them thinking I was gay that was a problem, this was just the way that they expressed that I didn't fit in with their narrow definition of what it means to be masculine, which they equate with heterosexuality. So I kind of want to wear a dress because fuck them, that's why.

3) I feel pretty and like the attention. I wore a dress one time before, and that night I got so many compliments on the way I looked. I don't think anyone other than my mom ever complimented an outfit of mine before then.

4) I like the perspective it gives me. The night I wore that dress, a lesbian grabbed my ass without my permission at a bar. And a group of drunk guys walked up to me on the street and started fondling my beard. I've never been groped or fucked with like that before.

I'm just worried that people won't take it seriously because I'm cis and hetero and have a large beard. I want to challenge peoples' views on masculinity, but without making fun of anyone who identifies as a woman, and without making fun of femininity. Anyone on here think this is a bad idea?",AskFeminists,1514660506,tnagi001,22,26,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7n3bow/is_it_okay_for_me_to_wear_a_dress/,2017-12-30

For instance, when we hear women say things like ""men only want one thing"". Not trying to paint men as the oppressed group here, but there *are* some widely held views out there about men being morally bankrupt, unempathetic, callous, and shallow. Those views seem to fit the dictionary definition of misandry, but in the past I've usually seen anyone calling it that met with a lot of opposition from feminists. What's the feeling here on this?

We all know the history of the sinking of the titanic in 1912, Where the captain ordered his crew to fill the lifeboats with women and children first. Some crewmembers misunderstood the order as ""women and children only"" such as Second officer Charles Lightoller who was in charge of the lowering of lifeboats on the port side, And he filled the boats with only women &amp; children except from some seaman who later on took control of the lifeboats while at sea. While First officer William Murdoch was in charge of the lifeboats on the starboard side, Filled the boats with women &amp; children first and if there wasn´t any women &amp; children to bee seen he allowed men into the lifeboats, And Murdoch was also much more effective with the filling and lowering of the lifeboats its estimated that 70% of the survivors from titanic was placed in boats he was in charge of. And most of the women who survived had to leave without their boyfriends/husbands and a few mothers had leave without their sons, There was a woman who was forced into one of the lifeboats because she was refused to leave without her 13 year old son who was not allowed into the lifeboat. And several other women was put into the lifeboats with force and in some cases the crew come into brawl with some male passengers, At about 1,5 hour into the sinking all of the four senior officers got a revolver in order to keep the men behind, But most of the men both crew &amp; passengers accepted to rule from the captain with relative ease. And american first class passenger Benjamin Guggenheim are believed to have said ""We are dressed up in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen"".

Yet, a lot of women seem to have issues with confidence (especially in terms of their body) and yet that never seems to affect their dating life in a significant way, at least from what I've observed. 

I know gender roles/patriarchy are a big part of the problem, and probably the biggest explanation, but I'm unsure if the answer really just boils down to that and JUST that (or maybe it is just that, but in a way that's less obvious than the standard reasons for why men and women are raised and treated differently in society). For one, even people within feminist circles I've met seem to feel this way (women still often say they're attracted to men with confidence, men still seem to care more about appearance). I know feminists are influenced by their patriarchal upbringing despite their rejection of gender roles, but you'd think this would still be less common because of their aforementioned rejection of gender roles, no? Also, why is confidence specifically so important in the first place? Why not stability or emotional strength? Also, confidence doesn't really seem to be as important in gay or lesbian relationships either from what I can tell (I can't say anything about lesbians from personal experience, but I've gone out with and been hit on by guys who didn't really care about my lack of confidence from what I could tell).

63,Question about men in the #metoo movement.,"One of my (male) friends posted about how his penis was grabbed repeatedly at a party, and used the #metoo hashtag.

While I understand that this is unwanted sexual contact, and I am absolutely against this, because he is a man he has male privilege and as such, the penis grabbing does not carry with it the society's historical context of subjugation of women. He is not affected by sexual harassment the same way women are.

As such, I feel it is inappropriate for men to use the #metoo hashtag. It's for sexual harassment of **women** not men. This distinction needs to be made because women are affected by sexual harassment in a much worse way than men - the harassment carries with it the societal objectification of women, but for men it does not apply.

I feel it as a form of cultural appropriation. The #metoo movement was made for women, it is part of female resistance against the sexual harassment from society. Men have no place in it, because they do not know what it's like to be a woman.

71,When is it ok to challenge / critique feminist writings and ideas?,"Floating around the internet and seeing various feminist writings, often there are comments challenging, rebutting or critiquing the content.


Sometimes the author (or others) will deny the validity of the comment, with something like, ""You are obviously a man (and/or not an expert in feminist theory) therefore you are not qualified to comment.""


This is an interesting issue:

- ""You're not an expert in math, therefore you're not qualified to comment on the correctness of this advanced mathematical theory.""   **I would be generally ok with this statement.**


- ""You're not an expert in banking, therefore you are not qualified to criticize the morality of global finance.""  **I'm not ok with this statement.**


- ""You're not a White Supremacist, therefore you're not qualified to critique the ideas of White Supremacy.""  **I wouldn't be ok with this statement.**


- ""You're not black, therefore you're not qualified to criticize the Black Lives Matter movement.""  **I'm a bit conflicted.  Maybe it depends on the specific topic?**

---------------

So when I make a comment and someone tries to shut me down with a ""You're not qualified"" sort of reply, how should I take this?

- Is it a correct statement that deep knowledge of feminism (and/or being a woman) is the necessary qualification for critiquing feminist writings?


- Or is it a rebuttal (possibly a fallacious one) that starts an debate that I can legitimately continue?

73,"Is it inherently sexist for a man to ""pursue"" a woman he's attracted to?","Lately I've been struggling with the seeming dichotomy between feminists support of sex positivity, and their distaste for men who ""sexualize"" them. I say this because when people comment about a woman having a lot of sexual partners, or dressing in a very provocative way, they're usually met with accusations of slut shaming. Inversely, if a man says that a woman looks sexy, or tries to pursue a sexual encounter with her, he's told that he's sexualizing that person, or being inappropriately predatory. Women should be viewed and approached the same as any other human being, with no sexual overtones or romantic motives. Full stop.

Now obviously there's a ton of nuance here, and there's a point where men become objectively gross and predatory. IE: cat calling, ogling women in the work place, or coming on to them in bizarre or inappropriate situations. But lately I'm wondering if some women think it's *never* an appropriate time for a man to find a woman attractive or pursue her. Almost as if women should dress sexy, but never be *seen* as sexy. At least not by men. Instead men should view those women as empowered, platonic human beings that they have no physical desire for. Sexual encounters meanwhile should only be initiated by women, with men playing a passive role and waiting politely on the sidelines until they are (hopefully) called up, lest they be seen as creeps. Until then speak only when spoken to, and wait your turn.

75,Is Brotopia written in an inclusive way? (Link in text),"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/brotopia-silicon-valley-secretive-orgiastic-inner-sanctum

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but when I was reading this article, I was shocked by conspicuous absence of race and sexuality throughout the article--an excerpt from a book supposedly written to tackle misogyny in Tech. 

&gt;If you’re reading this and shaking your head saying, “This isn’t the Silicon Valley that I know,” you may not be a rich and edgy male founder or investor, or a female in tech in her 20s.

Immediately, I wonder: are the men and women described here heterosexual? Would Peter Thiel be included in this description? 

Much further down, the answer is provided: no.

&gt;Women are often expected to be involved in threesomes that include other women; male gay and bisexual behavior is conspicuously absent.

Is a reasonable interpretation of this as subtly reinforcing heteronormativity? The author here describes (and is presumably against) the heteronormativity forced upon men and the fluid sexual assumptions forced upon women, yet (I think) she essentialized the sexualities of both genders throughout the entire article.

Moreover, I also wonder are Asian men (a sizable portion of VCs and tech) invited? The photo the authors provides seems to depict all white people. Is that important for this? Are the races of women invited roughly reflective of the tech scene/SF bay area? These questions are never answered. 

Do these questions have to be answered for an inclusive journalistic story? Do pieces like this further the ""othering"" of marginalized communities, including some classes of women, e.g., black women?

76,What is wrong with this idea about how to approach gender inequity issues?,"Hi.

I was wondering about this. I've noticed in a lot of these ""feminism"" / ""gender issues"" debates, the idea comes up, especially with those of an anti-feminist often ""conservative"" point of view that gender inequalities in things like hard mathematical sciences are simply due to some ""natural"" characteristic of women that they are either less naturally apt, but more commonly less naturally _want_ to go into those fields, and it has nothing at all to do with any kind of culture, etc. And then of course the feminist side would say either that's crap, or that they might want to go elsewhere but the reasons are social and not ""natural"", etc.

And what I'm wondering about is - and I'm not saying I support this point of view, rather I formulated it and am curious to ask about it - what happens if you just _dismiss_ the question of whether or not women ""naturally want"" to go into these fields as irrelevant and instead focus on how women are TREATED who go into these fields? Like the sexual harassment, the cat calls, the dissmissiveness, etc. that very often happens to those who end up there regardless of whatever is going on with the ""want barrier"" situation, and demand without apology that this be ended and is absolutely not acceptable in any way, shape, or form, and whatever cultural and social changes are required to change it should be instituted as vigorously as possible including stiff sanctions for all (particularly men) who engage in these kind of _behaviors_ toward women, then see what that does to the gender gaps. If it changes them, that's a boon, if not, then we can investigate that separately but most importantly we will have achieved equality of _TREATMENT_, which seems the most pressing and important moral issue as it is what is directly responsible for real pain and suffering caused to women - the very factor that is at the core of most moral judgments?",AskFeminists,1514977765,mike3,5,12,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7ntzwj/what_is_wrong_with_this_idea_about_how_to/,2018-01-03

Please understand the following:

* I believe that people shouldn't be judged for things they have no control over, the form of their genitals being one of them.

* All vaginas are beautiful

Now, a bit of explanation. Throughout history and even to this day, it's socially acceptable to judge (even harshly) men's genitals, such as saying things to the effect of:

&gt;Uncut/""outie"" penises are nasty!

Now, recently, imageboards (presumably) have given birth to the ""outie-meme"", ie. *""Outie vaginas are nasty""* (compare this with how it's socially acceptable to make judgments on whether or not penises are ""outie"" or ""innie"").

For example, if many women said ""kill all men"", I think many men are offended, but it isn't frightening in the same way that the inverse may be due to men's institutional power (could be way off here).  
But I think this creates a communication problem.  The people that are opposed to these ideas typically don't understand class theory, and they think of racism, for example, as a group of people of one race being physically violent toward a member of another race.  To those people, the notion that a group of POC attacking a white person because he's white isn't racist is absurd.  What is gained by saying that isn't racist?  Shouldn't the focus be on communicating effectively so that we can educate on the distinctive nature of systemic racism, sexism, etc?

It mostly consists of Stanford encyclopedia entries on the subject, a few works by Butler, and summaries of the different feminisms (like radical or liberal) that I find online from the various feminist communities/blogs.

While there is a great diversity of thought, enough that many ideas can even conflict quite strongly (like about gender/sex/porn between liberals and radicals), it seems that most of the ideas spring from the humanities, from philosophers and writers and activists, which I can understand given its history, but very little thinking that I would call deriving from a ""scientific"" mindset or background. I have read some pieces by women scientists, but they are usually about the practice itself (like lack of women in STEM and other barriers), rather than an application of scientific ideas and scrutiny to critique or create feminist ideology.

So my question is whether there are feminist works that derive from people who are scientists, particularly in STEM, that contribute to/critique feminist ideals from that perspective? Or is this an area that hasn't been explored much?

By ""scientific mindset"" I mean viewing the world from an empirical lens where there are *right* and *wrong* perspectives dictated by testing and evidence, and where concepts are tethered to reality through falsifiable theories that constrain and predict the world around us.",AskFeminists,1515117483,kakkapo,33,5,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7o7vck/can_there_be_or_is_there_a_scientific_feminism/,2018-01-04

99,"As a man of color, why should i accept this culture of rape allegations?"," It seems that our current culture is very accepting of just throwing out allegations and heralding the accusers claim as truth . Without due process , these men are still fired from their jobs and lose everything. Historically, men of color have always been at risk of rape allegations from white women and some  have been killed because of it. I can't think of a social ill that white men suffer more from compared to men of color. THis is to say , that if  once these rape allegations become normalized , men of color will likely suffer from it disproportionately. When white people have a cold, black people have pnuemonia. In general, i don't think anyone should accept this trend of accusing someone of sexual assault without sufficient evidence.

109,The Last Jedi: Anyone else have a tiny disappointment about Vice-Admiral Holdo? [Spoilers],"This feels pretty trivial for a sub that's typically pretty heavy, but I'll go ahead anyway.

So I finally saw The Last Jedi yesterday (thought it was pretty good). I particularly liked Vice-Admiral Holdo as a character, and her fate was kind of a drag because I would have loved to see more of her. But I found I had an odd feeling, which was sort of disappointment I think, at the point where she tells Leia that she actually *likes* Poe.

Anyone else get that feeling? I can't quite put my finger on it, whether it just seemed inconsistent with the character, or whether it seemed like someone rewarding a reckless male for being reckless (albeit behind his back). Clearly the notion of toxic masculinity is fairly prevalent in TLJ, and it really looked like Poe was kind of getting called out for it, but Holdo kind of validates it in the end anyway with that line, if only for the audience's ears.

However, I ultimately decided that I couldn't in good conscience give them financial support after finding out that they paid less than what would be considered a real living wage in our area (paying as low as $10 an hour for positions, when a fair, liveable wage for the city would be $15-$16).

My girlfriend is frustrated at this decision, and I've given it a second thoughts, but ultimately decided that it's the only way to ""vote with my dollar"" against organizations that don't pay enough for their employees to live a quality life.

With that having been said, this is my second attempt to earnestly gain an understanding on this topic, and I beg and plead for help in doing so.

So it's a socially acceptable thing to have a preference for circumcised penises over uncircumcised ones. Anyone can see this for themselves by googling ""circumcision preference"", but to highlight one example out of many, the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682798/), thought it acceptable enough to poll women on it. Furthermore, 76% of these women felt it was acceptable to report their preference for circumcised penises. So TL;DR: It's totally fine to say ""Uncircumcised penises are nasty!""

Now, on some imageboards there has been something of a role reversal of this, namely the ""outie-meme"", ie. ""Outie vaginas are nasty!"" This has been met with a vicious reaction, mostly being labeled as something to the effect of horrible misogyny. 

So my question is this: **Why is it fine to have preferences about penises, but not about vaginas?**

I am an Aussie male, left of centre, city living, tertiary educated etc etc, so I am somewhat familiar with distinctive and problematic aspects of our particularly 'treasured' brand of masculinity in this country. I find myself increasingly appalled at the liberal, and indeed somewhat celebrated use of the 'c' word here. You will always see it, for example, predictably and without exception, every time Aussies of a certain nature find themselves on a thread that hits /r/all and gets a global audience; it's a way of proving themselves as being 'true Aussies'.

What is increasingly grating to me is that it is specifically gendered language and I find it impossible to disassociate any 'affectionate' secondary or tertiary use from its normal meaning, and one that takes a pejorative perspective on female anatomy as assumed and mutually agreed upon.

My question is: (i) am I right to find this offensive to the point of being unacceptable even (perhaps especially) in its 'affectionate' use; (ii) are Australian feminists fighting to call this out?

Do you think this is a major reason as to why we see less women in executive and leadership positions?,"Summary of the relevant data Finally, Figure 3c summarizes how much participants would be willing to work, at most, if they held their ideal job. We wanted to assess willingness to devote time to developing a truly outstanding career, which requires going well beyond a 40-hr workweek. Arguably the most widely agreed-on aspect of talent development is that people at the forefront of any discipline invest an extraor- dinary amount of their time to developing expertise and, ultimately, working in their career (Ericsson, 1996; Simonton, 1994, 2014). Excellence requires doing more than is required, and there are only so many hours in the day. In Cohort 1, significantly different proportions of men and women selected each response option for this question (ps &lt; .01 for all options from “40 or more” to “70 or more” hours per week and p &lt; .05 for “80 or more” hours per week). In Cohort 2, sex differences were sig- nificant for four of the response options (p &lt; .01 for “40 or more” to “60 or more” and p &lt; .05 for “70 or more”; for further details, see Table S8 in the Supplemental Material). That 30% of women but only 7% of men reported being unwilling to devote 40 or more hours per week to work in their ideal job is germane for understanding differen- tial representation of men and women in high-level careers (Ceci, Ginther, Kahn, &amp; Williams, in press; Ceci &amp; Williams, 2007, 2011; Giles, 2011).

Courts focus primarily on evidence, hard evidence. A claim against someone usually won’t cut it, primarily because if accusing someone was all it took, a lot of people would take advantage of it.

Imagine if you are in a tight situation financially, to get some easy cash, you just accuse someone of rape and that’s all it takes. The reason false rape accusations are low now is because people know they usually won’t go anywhere. Unless it’s a respectable person of power. People are not dumb, and morality is not a strong enough force to keep people from the wrong thing. Money is much more powerful than morality.

So I would like to know either more about what “believe accusations” means (is it meant in just emotional support, or is this intended for actual legal belief) or what feminists think of my POV. 


Edit for clarity: I have no issue with pressing charges or requests for emotional support/acceptance, my issue is for the advocation of believing someone with their only evidence being word of mouth in a legal setting which is what I think (may be wrong) feminists advocate for",AskFeminists,1512971790,Surprisinglysound,16,0,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7j0b7v/false_rape_accusations/,2017-12-11
27,Isn't sex positive too easily abused?,"&gt;Sex-positivity is ""an attitude towards human sexuality that regards all consensual sexual activities as fundamentally healthy and pleasurable, encouraging sexual pleasure and experimentation"".

While that sounds nice, it really doesn't make sense. Consent doesn't erase the harms that can result from sex and not every sex act is fundamentally healthy or even pleasurable. 

Sex and sexual experimentation, for the vast majority of women, involves sex with men, and all the inequalities and pressure that come along with that. You've got men who are watching porn, and taking part in what's labeled as raunch culture, and they have expectations and demands about sex. Especially with younger women, they may consent to many of these outrageous expectations like anal, humiliating acts, etc but that doesn't mean they're not hurt by the experience. 

I don't know if I'm explaining this well but I guess my question is: when we live in a society that teaches men sexist things about sex, aren't women pressured into doing those things because if every guy wants it then it will be normal? And sex positive feminism doesn't really provide an answer for that because ""consent"" is all that matters?

Is it important to you to consider oppression and discrimination through an intersectional lens?

Context:

I'm a feminist and have noticed a troubling trend in some feminist groups. Some feminists seem to pick and choose the oppressed identities that they think deserve attention. For example a group might believe in intersectionality in terms of race and sexual orientation but ignore the role of socioeconomic status. Or they might believe in it in terms of religion but ignore race.

42,Submissive Boyfriend or Femdom?,"Please Help. I [21M] have been dating my girlfriend [21F] for 3 years now, both in college, active, happy and healthy. we've pretty much done everything together and have a strong relationship IMO (besides when we have fights about porn). We've been really good friends for 7 years. She doesn't like me watching watching porn and is somewhat okay with me masturbating without it. I'm probably addicted to porn because I've let it threaten our relationship. I have loved her for 7 years and don't want this to get in the way.


That being said **I think porn and masturbation are very normal for a guy my age** and I know a lot of girls who don't care about porn in a relationship and I know some girls don't like it/won't allow it in a relationship.


My gf and I have had the porn discussion several times. I really do want to stop but go back and forth between rather she's being irrational or not. I will go a week or so without porn then ill go a week or so with it every single day, sometimes twice. I am in no way attracted to porn the way way I am attracted to her. I still have a high sex drive so it does not effect our sexual relationship at all. 


Regardless of whether I think shes being irrational or not, **she absolutely has the right to ask me to stop watching porn and I fully understand how bad it hurts her feelings and how it can be considered cheating.** I want to stop watching porn and don't want it to damage our relationship.


I get a lot of sexual and personal/emotional satisfaction from only having orgasms from her. I am a fairly masculine person (sports, party, etc) except when I'm with her and especially in bed I am submissive. She is a fairly strong feminist (not a feminazi) but about as strong as a male feminist would be. I explained to her how hard it was for me to resist porn when she's gone for a few days so we recently (2 weeks) got a chastity cage (I brought it up) I wore it for a week (took it off for sex) and she hasn't asked me to put it back on. She lets me masturbate whenever I need to but she tells me how, when, where, etc so that way it feels like I'm masturbating for her. I liked wearing the cage because I has so much more energy and worked out everyday that week and slept really well, and especially because I did not have to worry about fighting my urges. She is absolutely against porn, she really likes the whole controlling my orgasms thing but understands sometimes I just have to masturbate.



TMI Warning but she usually holds my balls tight during sex and cuddling and she likes face sitting and stuff, all of which I also enjoy. Shes not huge on the chastity cage I think she'd just rather have me control my own urges. She's pretty against anything that would make her the submissive one or ""degrading to women"" like cumming on her face or anal. I want to give up control on some level because I lack the self-control, but I'm unsure of if I'm doing it in a healthy way. I consider myself to be socially dominant, I am a engineering student, and often take leadership roles in class and sports and life.



**Now I'm concerned if I have a femdom fetish or If I am actually just submissive and want to be a good bf.** Also somewhat concerned that I'm ""whipped"" for lack of a better term, my friends have jokingly called me a cuckold before but this was before the chastity cage and everything. I'm submissive in bed but we've never done anything weird/kinky. I've watch femdom porn before and got off to it but really don't think that's who I am because I'm not like this 99% of the time. **where is the line drawn between femdom, submissiveness, and being a good boyfriend?** If the submissiveness helps me stop watching porn and therefor helps our relationship should we continue our current route or is it just part of a fetish that will hurt us in the long run?
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

43,Could campus SU's be preventing the emergence of a healthy MRM?,"I'm brand new here, so hopefully I don't run afoul of any sub rules. 
I've just read through much of the thread about whether feminists oppose any MRM or the current manifestation of it. I've also read a lot over the past few months about the case of the Men's Issues Awareness Group at Ryerson, and what has happened at other campuses. What bothers me most about the trend is that some student unions, at the urging of feminists, have actually tried to ban men's issues groups on campuses before they've even begun, apparently on the assumption that they will inevitably become misogynistic hotbeds. 

I've also seen here that many feminists believe that men DO need a movement, and one distinct from feminism, to address their issues. I agree wholeheartedly with that. One of my frustrations with feminism is that its solutions to men's problems tend to be very ""feminine"" solutions - ones that would work well for women, were they faced with the same issue, but don't serve men nearly as well. I think that more progress would be made if men created their own solutions that work for them.

I agree that much of the current MRM is trash. They get a few things right, then get everything else wrong, in my opinion. They're right about nearly all of the issues they identify that disproportionately affect men, but they royally screw it up after that by (1) asserting that they have anything to do with ""rights"" (ok, a couple of issues do, but most don't) and (2) blaming women and feminism for the issues.

But if new men's groups are prevented from even forming, well before any evidence of misogyny in their ideology is detected, are these SU's not actually standing in the way of a potentially much healthier men's movement coming to be? Would it not be better to allow these groups to form, while holding them to a fair code of conduct after the fact, than to end them before they even begin?

52,Can I ask for advice about whether or not I went too far with a coworker's friend on a date?,"So this might just be my anxiety talking. But I'm concerned about whether or not I went too far with a date. A year ago or so, I met a girl on OKC, we agreed to trade numbers. Sometime before or after we traded numbers, I asked her what she was looking for. I don't recall exactly what was said, but I think we agreed that we were both interested in casual sex.

It turns out that she knows my coworker, and the thing that has me concerned is that my coworker has been a bit distant to me lately. Before three months ago or so, my coworker was always friendly and we were kind of friends, but not that close.  That's all changed. She doesn't speak to me unless I approach her with a question or if I initiate the conversation.  And then, it's always a super-short monosyllabic response. I don't think her behavior has changed much otherwise. She also skipped a team lunch we had a few weeks ago. She still talks to other people about as much. However, in the same time-frame, she's started a high-profile project, so the stress could be causing it, but I don't think so.

When I was on the date with my coworker's friend, I walked her back to her place and I asked her several times whether or not she wanted to hookup. I believe that my last few times might have been a little too insistent. She never gave a definitive no until possibly the last time, but she may have hinted and suggested that she didn't want it, like ""not right now"" or perhaps changing the conversation. I really don't completely remember.

My question is, are the two possibly correlated? Is it possible or even likely that my coworker's friend told her about the date and my coworker thinks that I'm pressuring women or worse? I feel bad about the way I behaved on that date and I'm always better now. I always ask before I kiss girls and if they aren't interested or give non-committal answers now, I stop asking.

To what extent does society pressure women to wear make up? I can 100% believe that many/most women are not seeking to impress men by wearing make up, but I don't think this necessarily implies that there's no societal coercion going on. 

I have seen women (here and elsewhere) talk about wearing make up 'as a hobby' or 'because it makes them feel good'. However, I expect that very few women would spend time putting on make up on a day that they weren't planning to leave the house/meet anyone. Or would they? If not, doesn't this imply that the purpose of make up is to look more attractive in the eyes of other people (though not just men)?

My impression, in the past, has been that there's a bit of a feeling of guilt associated with make up. One might feel that 'being a good feminist' means casting off the shackles of the patriarchy, not being pressured to conform to beauty standards etc. On that point, I would not judge anyone for simultaneously decrying the beauty industry and wearing makeup themselves.

60,"Are women-only malls, public events and spaces in general feminist?","I am a dual national of Canada and Pakistan, and a student studying at the University of Toronto. I grew up in Pakistan, and went to a private British school there. I recently visited Pakistan to deal with some issues regarding a property dispute about an orphanage my family runs there. Many malls in Pakistan ban single males from entering malls on weekends. Even married and old men must be accompanied by a female to enter malls. The same is the case with many parks, buses and publicly funded events. Even in co-ed buses have women-only seats at the most convenient spaces in the front, with extra wide spaces. Then there are women-only taxis, rickshaws and shops. No male-only equivalent exists. Several feminist organizations have expressed support of these policies. How is this feminist at all?

63,Feminism and trans-homophobia,"Hey,

I am woman and lesbian. I was born with a penis, and until a few months ago I identified as a man. 

I still have penis and very high testosterone (for a woman). I am not going to have hormone replacement therapy or reassignment surgery any time soon. I will wait until it improves and has zero side effects. I also want to have more children in future.

I discussed some issues with people who identified as feminist (mostly cis-gender straight white women). It was very disturbing for me. They claimed to be pro-trans, but most of them were transphobic homophobes. 

Some examples:

- trans women should not have abortion rights

- trans women should not be included in prisons and shelters with cis-women

- they refused to check their cis-gender privilege

- refused to admin that male circumcision is a feminist issue (since it only affect cis-gender women)

- refused to admin that military draft is a feminist issue, trans women do not need right to vote or driving licence

- people like me should not be included in affirmative action, it is ok to hire cis-gender women over trans-lesbians

- I am not ""real woman"" until I have complicated surgery. What happened to ""my body, my choice""?

- two slept with me, but refused to admin they are lesbians

I found this very disturbing. My impression is that feminism claims to support trans rights. But it only goes up to toilets. On more complicated issues trans-women are thrown over board.

What is your take on this? Is that how most feminists feel?

On the one hand, good for her (no sarcasm) because she is confident about herself and loves her body. But on the other hand, isn't posting nude photos in obviously sexual conditions/poses directly contributing to the objectification of women? 

It seems counterintuitive to feminism for women to seek the majority of her validation and self esteem by posting pictures that are only sexually explicit in nature.  I say majority because the majority of her social media posts are explicit in nature. But at the same time, I don't want to body shame or slut shame anyone for choosing how they want to display their body. Although the woman in question may be empowered by posting her nudes publicly, won't the people/men who see it only view her as a sex object as a result?

88,"Feminism, safe spaces and mental illness","A little background, first of all: I'm a pro-feminist male, and I've been involved in various kinds of pro-feminist activism since the late 90's. Because the personal is political, I have also attempted to live my own life by feminist principles to the extent I can.

However, I'm also disabled and seriously mentally ill. I have generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and am diagnosed on the autism spectrum. Attempting to engage with feminism and to live by feminist principles have rather consistently exacerbated some of my illnesses, inasmuch as certain kinds of feminist messaging tend to cause me debilitating mental distress over my own inadequacy as an ally, crippling guilt over being a member of an oppressor class I cannot possibly leave, or give me cause to morally justify anxiety symptoms. Offline, I live in near-total isolation, and I find myself (to my therapist's dismay) thinking that it's *good* for me to do so, because I'm doing so specifically to avoid transgressing against feminist principles. For example, I generally avoid interaction with strange women when I can, *specifically* thinking about how I'm Schrödinger's Rapist to them. I avoid many social spaces *specifically* because my mind starts repeating that as a male, I bring an implicit threat of violence with me into any space I enter. I've pushed away all my friends. I'm lonely and miserable and ill. And I keep worrying that my therapy will make me a worse ally, because my jerkbrain keeps parsing feminist messaging as ""IN MEN, CRIPPLING ANXIETY IS GOOD"".

This isn't ""feminism's fault"", obviously, but being near-constantly exposed to feminist messaging that trigger these thought patterns *isn't* good for me. I find myself thinking that as a male, I shouldn't have the option to choose to *avoid* feminist messaging (because women don't have the option to avoid patriarchal oppression either), but I can't take any more of this; I'm worried that I'm headed for a bad end. I have three questions for this community: 

1. Would it be considered acceptable to try to avoid engaging with feminism and avoiding feminist messaging for a period, or would this be unacceptable in an ally?
2. All explicit safe spaces are feminist spaces, but since some people have mental illness that get triggered by certain kinds of feminist rhetoric, would it be acceptable for ""feminist-rhetoric-free spaces"" (given that they're explicitly non-expansionist and also don't accept anti-feminist rhetoric) to exist?

So recently I have been having more and more difficulty coming to terms with life as a woman (I love being a woman but I am constantly frustrated at the social limitations posed onto me).

I've always hung out with guys, I've just always been more interested in things that the media portrays as boy activities. Although I love it, and hanging out with guys, I hate it when they have boys only events and have been feeling more and more left out of things. In my head I don't know why boys and girls have to be separated and I wish that there weren't these boundaries between us. When I was travelling it wasn't as bad because there are more mixed groups.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this because it really gets me down and I know things aren't gonna change any time soon and a lot of the time I feel really lonely, although more and more girls are exploring activities typically considered male which is great. I think if I had more girl friends it wouldn't be as much of an issue maybe?

I'm lucky I have the most amazing boyfriend ever who has said he wouldn't go to something if I wasn't invited for that reason but I don't want to be a girlfriend who tells him no to go to something (we have no problem with each other going out without the other one), at the same time I hate being uninvited to something just because I'm a girl especially when I just want to be seen for who I am and not what gender I am.

This is the first relationship I've been in and I love my boyfriend so much but I always used to feel like number 1, now a lot of the time I feel unimportant and ""just a girlfriend"" to other people.

101,What is the deal with Germaine Greer?,"I have read that she is one of the major voices of the second wave feminist movement, but I have also read that she wrote a book called The Beautiful Boy, which was basically promoting the sexualization of underage boys.

And she also said: ""Well, I'd like to reclaim for women the right to appreciate the short-lived beauty of boys, real boys, not simpering 30-year-olds with shaved chests.""

How is this lady regarded by feminists? Is she actually respected or is she seen as a wacko?

105,Feminist positions on masculinity/femininity,"This question will take a bit of explanation. So we hear feminists talk about toxic masculinity, and when some people misunderstand that and react badly to it, feminism points out that there is a distinction between toxic masculinity and *masculinity*, sort of implying that one is the unhealthy distortion of the other. The usual response is that feminism doesn't think masculinity is toxic, suggesting that feminism on some level accepts a notion of masculinity. We also hear talk that so much of toxic masculinity is based in the notion that the feminine is inferior.

All of this sort of presupposes that there is a legitimate notion of what authentic masculinity and femininity are. At the same time, though, we hear some feminists talk about masculinity and femininity being nothing more than patriarchal/cultural constructs, and resisting any attempt to define either one.

Taken all together, the message that seems to come across is ""no, we don't hate masculinity, we just sort of think that it shouldn't... exist...""

Is this a result of different schools of thought within feminism, or different points on a spectrum? Or is there a sort of unifying theory within feminism that reconciles recognizing healthy masculinity and femininity with rejecting gender roles? I'm sort of confused by this, so I'm really interested in what the folks here have to say.

106,"It seems women can always tell if I am attracted to them even when I am not trying to show interest, am I in the wrong?","I often see people saying that it is inappropriate to hit on someone who is in a position where they are serving you, such as a waitress of a customer service person. I can agree with this to some extent. However, it depends on if what is being considered inappropriate is actual advances, where you are asking for a the person's time or if it includes merely showing interest in the person.

Me personally, I have noticed that women always seem to be able to tell when I am attracted to them. I am actually really shy and tend to be very careful not to show interest in most situations, however even in these situations women seem to be aware of it. I am not sure if it is my unconscious mannerisms or facial expressions or what. Usually they seem extra nice but I remember some situations where women have been rude to me and I had no idea why: I always suspect it is a response to my perceived interest in them. 

Well, unfortunately, I do often find myself attracted to waitresses and other women I encounter in customer service. And yes they can usually tell. So it seems I am showing interest by default. Does this mean I am in the wrong? But the problem is there is really nothing I can do about it since it is unconscious.

109,UK Police &amp; Sex Crime Evidence,"I read [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42417553) article on the BBC this morning, which says that the Met (London's police force) is to review a large number of cases involving sex crimes because it seems that the police involved in these investigations were purposefully withholding relevant evidence.

In particular, this quote from a former deputy assistant commissioner struck a chord:

&gt;""When I did a review of rape investigations in the Met in 2005, the problem was the police didn't believe the people making the allegations,"" he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme.

&gt; ""Now my concern is... that the culture may have shifted so that the complainant is always believed and an even-handed investigation may not be taking place.""

In previous discussions on this subreddit and elsewhere, I've heard it said that it's quite possible to 'always believe the victim' while simultaneously maintaining 'innocent until proven guilty', but doesn't this quite perfectly demonstrate the dangers of that attitude?

The Met, and I imagine other UK police forces, were quite right to make a policy change after the findings of the 2005 review, but it seems that, in some places, they have gone too far the other way. Would you agree with that? What can be done, if anything, to find the proper middle ground between ""don't believe accusers"" and ""convict all accused, even if it means withholding evidence""?

More generally and only somewhat related: what should constitute admissible evidence in cases like these? I can see the argument that an accuser's sexual history should not be admissible, but what does that include? In one of the cases the article discusses, the evidence in question was several thousand messages from the accuser to the accused 'pestering him for casual sex'. Should that be admissible?",AskFeminists,1513772573,hoohoohoo2,30,8,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/7l129h/uk_police_sex_crime_evidence/,2017-12-20

111,Why do feminists oppose gender biased laws but justify women-only domestic and sexual violence laws?,"No one advocates for men-only homicide or assault laws simply because men are the majority victims of it, and they shouldn't, then why is this rhetoric used to justify women-only laws?
I'm a dual Canadian and Pakistani citizen and the UN Women has advocated for a domestic violence law that doesn't even recognize male victims in Pakistan. How is this not unfair to male victims? Furthermore, the law itself has super biased clauses, such as asking the accused to pay for the living expenses for the accuser and forcing them to wear an ankle monitor BEFORE they are even convicted. The law itself is non bailable. 
So:
1) a male victim can enjoy being abused because he belongs to the wrong gender
2) an accused person has to wear an ankle monitor, pay the livo g exoenses of the accuser and sit in jail simply because they were accused and not convicted
3) if the compmaintant lies, the maximum punishment they can get is three months in jail and a fine equialent to $500 dollars

114,"GoT, Shameless, and perceptions of both","So I've seen a bit of discussion over on the thread about ""The Little Hours"" (haven't seen it, didn't see fit to engage there) that often brought up Game of Thrones. This got me wondering a little.

Personally, I love GoT. But I'm curious how feminists see the rape scenes in it (they are obvious and plenty). The Drogo/Danaerys situation, I agree, is problematic due to the whole ""she learns to love him"" treatment, and the storyline there sort of dismisses what really happened. But I see the claim that shows like this ""normalize"" rape of women. I saw this differently, especially in the case of the Ramsey/Sansa situation. Far from normalizing rape or making it in any way acceptable, it seemed to me that it was being used to horrify audiences at Ramsey's character, and that's not the only instance in the series of violence against women being used to vilify a character. Which is my first question here: do feminists feel that any portrayal of violence against women constitutes ""normalizing""? Or is it ever appropriate when used to horrify audiences with a male's unquestionably deplorable behaviour? None of these scenes seemed lighthearted or dismissive of what was going on.

Next question, along similar lines: Shameless. Loved the show, but saw some problems with it. This series had a number of instances of women raping men, the first of which was quite clearly intended to be comedic (Sheila's rape of Frank). Later we see Frank raped by Karen, and the fact that it is even referred to as rape by characters within the show seems intended to be shocking. We see Lip raped, we see Mickey raped, both with no real acknowledgement of the moral severity of the events. None of these events in the series seemed to be any kind of ironic commentary on rape in general, and from what I read, and the reactions of friends who watched the show, a lot of women didn't even recognize these scenes as rape. I didn't read a lot about feminists reactions to Shameless. What were your reactions?

136,I want to understand modern feminism.,"I would like to start out by saying I have a pretty negative view of modern feminism in the first world. I believe that feminism has accomplished so many great things in the past. I also believe feminism is greatly needed in countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran. I personally believe men are just as oppressed in the first world as women.

I agree with feminists on the issues of female genital mutilation in third world countries and the treatment of women in countries that practice Sharia law among other things.

I have also come to notice that many feminists talking points include mansplaining and manspreading. Both of which I completely disagree with.

I was wondering if feminists agree with any issues pushed by men's rights activists. Do feminists see a problem with men recieving longer prison sentences for commiting the same crimes as a woman? Do feminists agree that the draft is an outdated, unnecessary, and discriminatory practice. I'm also wondering if feminists feel the same way about circumcision as they do about female genital mutilation. I personally think both are horrible. Last of all, I'm wondering if feminists agree that false rape accusations are a serious problem. It is my opinion that they are dangerous to both MRAs and feminists. If false accusations become more common then won't law enforcement be less likely to believe women who have actually been raped? These are just some of the questions I have.

I have also come to notice that some of the most vocal people in the feminist movement have very negative and discriminatory views against men. Is that all feminism is now? Do all feminists believe that men are their evil nazi oppressors or is it just a small percentage of the movement that believes this?

I want to understand both sides of the story. I want to understand the modern feminist movement. I was hoping you could leave me with a more positive view of the modern feminist movement.

I also want to say that both genders have their strengths and weaknesses. I wish as human beings we could all learn to understand and accept each others differences.

141,Do you think steroids should be legalized/decriminalized?,"Personally I think its bad that men and women can't choose what they want to do with their own bodies, now I'm not saying it should be legal for those under 18 or that it should be used without a doctor's supervision, but its truly pissening that young men and women end up sick or dead because they were forced by the legal system to buy from shady people, and without a doctor's supervision

142,"About matt damon's opinions on sexual harrasment, does he deserve this kind of punishment?","I wanted to know what you think about, matt's opinions. As far as i know, he stated that, 1- Sexual harassment is a spectrum, and each case deserves a different punishment. 2- We need not only to punish them but to work with them and rehabilitate them like we do with all criminals/sick people So what do you think, does he deserve being kicked out of his latest movie? My opinion is he doesnt, his opinions are not motivating violence, they are just opinions that disagree with what some feminists believe ( i don't know too much about US' feminist movement, so i can't really tell how much ""hate"" and/or disagreement is matt damon recieving) Thanks a lot.

144,"Hello feminists, what are my privileges in my daily life as a man?","So I have a dear friend whom I constantly debate with, mostly about feminism. I consider myself very progressive and used to call myself a feminist, but I'm wandering away somewhat. Some time ago she asked me: 
""are you aware of your privilege?""
""You mean that I'm more likely to get a job and might earn more money?""
""No not that... but I mean in your daily life""
After a few moments I said:
""No i don't think so, what do you mean?""
She couldn't give me any example, and since I didn't want to put her on a spot I just let it go, but she has failed ever since to give me any examples. So since I hate both being ignorant/borderline sexist as well as being accused of it, I need your help to narrow it down to one 🙏

146,Thoughts on one university’s feminism?,"Here’s the article: http://nationalpost.com/opinion/christie-blatchford-pay-raise-for-women-at-wilfrid-laurier-creates-new-inequity-for-men

It’s a university in Canada. I’d love to read some discussion about the pros and cons of policy like this. Personally, as a libertarian feminist, I’m all for the *right* of the university to do this and decide on salaries but it’s complicated by the fact that Canadian universities are also publicly supported.

147,A way of explaining catcalling to men - thoughts and criticims?,"I've had this idea in my head for a while, and I'd really appreciate some of your thoughts on this. Just yesterday I was having a conversation with a male co-worker regarding cat-calling. He's 19, and is, for lack of a better term, your typical ""cocky"" 19 year-old guy. He loves to drive a fancy car and happily talks about calling out to pretty women on the street as he drives by, and he seemed convinced that many of them enjoyed it. 

Here's the way I've explained this to men: Imagine that you take all of your life savings out of the bank in cash. It's a lot. Now you put it in a transparent ziplock back and hang it on a chain around your neck, where' it's visible to the world, and you can't take it off. You have to walk through life like this, everywhere, every day.

Now also imagine that at least half the population is twice your size and it's very obvious that they could easily overpower you at will any day of the week.

Now imagine walking down the street alone, and having those people constantly eyeing that bag of cash around your neck. They're strangers, you don't know them. Now some of them start commenting on it. ""How much you got in there?"" ""Hey, can I have some of that?"" ""I could do *so many things* with what you've got in there...""

Remember that virtually all of the people making these comments absolutely have the capacity to take it from you by force. How do you feel?

What do you folks think of this comparison? I feel like it's kind of a start but doesn't really get all the way there. The kid I was talking to seemed to understand the point, and I think it at least started to sink in to him just how intimidating it could be to women. I also pointed out to him that a lot of women are conditioned to *act* as though they like it, smile and nod, because they're actually worried about how a man may react if they stand up to it.

I came up with this comparison, and as a male who has never really been subjected to street harassment, I've had to sort of apply imagination to this, so I could be waaaay off here, which is why I'm asking. I'd love to have a good way to explain the phenomenon to men who don't see the damage they're doing. I don't really like using a bag of cash as a metaphor for a woman's body and sexuality, but I'm kind of at a loss for a better one.
