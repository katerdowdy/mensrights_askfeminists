    "I kept the AskFeminists and MensRights dataframes separate during the cleaning process. For submissions, I combined 'title' and 'selftext' content into one 'text' column. I created columns to track posts/comments that were removed (by a moderator) or deleted (by a poster). AskFeminists had 1,847 removed posts/comments, about twice as many as MensRights. I removed links, numbers, characters, and references to '[removed]' or '[deleted]' from the text and lemmatized it (keeping stopwords in.) After lemmatizing, I removed contraction leftovers (ex. 'nt', 've') so they wouldn't skew the vectorizer counts."

You may need an etrade account to see that page.  \\n\\nFrom that page, emphasis mine:\\n\\n&gt;Looking to invest in ways that support the values of gender diversity and efforts to achieve it? The fund below invests in companies that are leaders in areas such as equitable hiring, equal pay, and the ***advancement of women into managerial, executive, and director positions***.\\n\\nScreenshot of the page:\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/a/etn0B3g](https://imgur.com/a/etn0B3g)\\n\\nThey are in my opinion making an argument for female supremacy by only emphasizing \"powerful\" jobs.  If they were advocating for equal opportunity in all jobs then that would be OK.  They aren't though, they are just saying, \"advance women into managerial, executive, and director positions.\"   \n",
