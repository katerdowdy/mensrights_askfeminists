    "Before combining the two subreddit dataframes into one for modeling, I tested out different vectorizing options on both to compare the two subreddits. I tried out CountVectorizer and TFIDF on the AskFeminists content setting ngrams = (3-5) to get the top phrases from both: TFIDF was less repetitive than the CountVectorizer so I used TFIDF for vectorizing throughout. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried vectorizing on ngrams 3-5, 1-2, and just single words, and created two custom lists of stopwords: one with all English stopwords and words in common between the top 100 words (without stopwords) from each subreddit; the second list of stopwords was created after fitting TFIDF on both subreddits (with stopwords = the first custom list) and taking the common words from the top 100 lists of words for each subreddit again. I tested models with both sets of stopwords and ultimately they didn't improve the model over using stopwords = 'english.')\n",

    "The best test score I had ended up being on Logistic Regression (76% accuracy compared to baseline of 50%). This model was overfit on the training data (85% accuracy), and setting lower max_features closed the gap to a 3% difference between training/testing scores but also lowered the test scores. \n",

    "It would be too easy to say that my best model's inability to crack 77% accuracy means that \"we're really not that different after all\", and if I were to spend more time on this project there are other options I would explore to try and improve my model:\n",

    "1. I'd pull a completely unrelated subreddit to test as a control against the other two subreddits to make sure I was tuning the best model possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given how important context is for the comments, I would either try to aggregate comments on a post and analyze them together, or set a minimum wordcount on comments to be used in the analysis to give the model a better chance of distinguishing them.\n",

    "3. I could scrape another years' worth of data to add to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I could do some more cleaning and EDA that might help consolidate slang/similar terms that weren't captured by the lemmatizer, and identify stronger trends in the subreddits that could be leveraged for better prediction. It'd also be interesting to see what difference it might make to fit the TFIDF on just one subreddit first, then transform both subreddits and analyze them together.\n",

    "The really interesting questions this project has generated would require a deeper analysis: what's the overlap in people who post on MensRights and AskFeminists? (How many of those are trolls, whose content is removed?) What common themes exist between removed posts (can we write an algorithm for trolling content?) How does sentiment analysis compare across the two subreddits, is there a discernable difference? Is it possible to measure 'extreme' attitudes in a subreddit, and if so can it be mapped over time, against real events happening in the world that might trigger anger on both or one side? Is it possible to follow the posts of single users and see how they change in sentiment and neutrality over time (and does the sub they post on the most make a difference?) Maybe I'll come back to it when I've solidified my modeling skills."
